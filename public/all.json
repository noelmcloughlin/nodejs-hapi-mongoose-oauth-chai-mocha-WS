        "description": "<p><strong>Lough Foyle</strong> C660-390          Sheet 3/4 Embarkation The logical embarkation point for the outer regions of Lough Foyle is Magilligan Point, by the Martello Tower. Access is by the B202 past the prison and rifle range. Do not block roads. Park by the hotel. The whole region is a security area, frequently patrolled. Especially beware of the military zone on the beach immediately to the E of the point, Benone Beach, on which it’s better not to land (certainly not while firing is going on). Accurate information for those passing the firing range can now be obtained from CANI. Further to the E, beyond the military zone, there is public access at about C716-363. There is a concrete slip across the beach. However, the beach surfs and there is a strong tidal drift. This may have relevance for launching. Expect caravans, lifeguards, and beach casting anglers. Military installations on both sides show the importance of the lough in such terms. The whole lough is less interesting inwards to the SW. There are large areas of mudflats on the E side. That said, it is a busy, well marked and well lit area. It is excellent for night navigation, sheltered but with strong tides. If paddling up into the city, it is possible to take out at Prehen Boat Club upstream of the Craigavon Bridge on the E bank. Road access is better on the Donegal side and there are nice secluded beaches. Greencastle at C648-400 lies directly across from Magilligan Point. The Donegal shore gets the more interesting up towards Inishowen Head at C685-438. The sea is much more exposed beyond the head. Tides Fierce tides push through the narrows. Rates of 3.5kn should not be treated lightly. Eddies on the Donegal side run from Warren Point to Moville and are usable on both flood and ebb.

Turbulent water can be experienced quite a distance offshore. The flood at the mouth is weak by comparison to the ebb. Especially when the river is up, the ebb and the flow of the river combine to produce mighty standing waves. The flow of the river is controlled by floodgates well upstream. Powerful rip currents either side of the mouth are dangerous enough. The mouth artificially narrows the stream and this projects the fresh water out with great force. The fresh water is easily distinguished in the sea water and gives a good guide as to tide direction and strength off the beaches. The river is marked as far up as Coleraine.

On passage however, give them plenty of clearance. Stay at least 200<em>m</em> clear of the E harbour entrance to avoid a boomer called the Blind Rock. Bushfoot is named for the River Bush which flows in here at the SW corner. Upriver 2<em>km</em> is the town of Bushmills, famed globally for its Black Bush whiskey. The beach tends to surf and should be used with caution. After rain, a brown tongue of water enters the sea and what happens to it is a good guide to what the tide is doing just then. The E part of the beach is irregularly rocky and not a good place for small boats. There is a small slip below Runkerry House at C934-435. The coastline eastwards is the Giant’s Causeway section. It is committing and there are no easy landing places. It is also one of the most beautiful sections of the entire Northern Ireland coastline. Just SE of the off-lying rock, the Mile Stone at C934-440, is the massive and beautiful Runkerry Cave at C935-439, complete with boulder beach and long dry passage. There are other caves hereabouts, most notably in a small cove 0.5<em>km</em> E of Runkerry called locally Portcoon, with a dry side entrance. There is a slip in Portnaboe, the last cove before the Causeway proper. Visitors once walked from this point, before the access from above was organised. The Causeway section itself is 5<em>km</em> around Benbane Head (C965-461). There are many exposures of geological features; dykes, sills and the various layers of volcanic activity are easily seen. The Causeway itself and all the related geology are far better seen from seaward. In strong offshore winds there are vicious down draughts and each of the bays can funnel the wind to strong gusts. Formidable tides run off Benbane Head and great seas can build up off it and off Bengore Head 1<em>km</em> E. The Spanish Armada The tragedy of the <em>Girona</em>, wrecked at Lacada Point C952-455, was that it was the most seaworthy of several ships that sailed on 16<sup>th</sup> October 1588 from Killybegs for Scotland. 1300 were drowned, including members of most of the noblest families in Spain. The remains of the wreck were discovered c1967 by a team of divers and a great number of artifacts including many many trinkets and jewellery did survive in the cracks and crevices off the Point, as well as cannons, cannonballs and other memorabilia which are now in The Ulster Museum in Belfast. Port Moon Port Moon at C979-451 on the E side of Contham Head C978-4456 is a natural small boat harbour among low rocks at the base of a 60<em>m</em> cliff. A bothy with a rusty roof marks the spot to the passerby, as do the salmon net poles around it, when close in. The bothy is presently the subject of a renovation programme which should be finished by summer 2011. The gut is 100<em>m</em> by 8<em>m</em> and there are rings on either side for shorelines. The port enjoys 1.5<em>m</em> LWS at the outer end. Landing is possible onto a sheltered but rough and stony shore/slip. Camping is nearby on grass, and there is even a stream. It has the remote feel of an island, despite a steep zig-zag path up the cliff to the public Causeway Coast Path. The coastline eastwards towards Dunseverick Castle falls away, but is bouldery. There is a small, well-sheltered harbour near Dunseverick at C999-447, about 1<em>km</em> E of the castle ruin, with a small maritime museum and good enough parking. Camping is possible here but forbidden, except in emergency. There are some lovely rock pools just W of the harbour, suitable for swimming and diving. This carpark has saved many a kayaker a long trip (E/W) if the weather breaks. Leaving a car at Dunserevick on a coastal passage is recommended.</p>\n",

White Park Bay to the E is particularly beautiful. Portbraddan is a small harbour at the W end of the beach at D008-444. It boasts the smallest church in Ireland. Access and parking are poor. It is possible to launch off a boulder beach. Very pretty. The salmon fishery, as with all those on the N coast, is closed. Wild salmon numbers in the Atlantic generally dropped alarmingly in the late twentieth century.  Great controversy still persists as to the causation.  Over fishing, global warming, diseases affecting the wild stock caused by sea lice endemic with farmed stock, all are blamed.  Stocks of similarly depleted wild Sea Trout have shown some signs of recovery recently, and perhaps wild salmon may someday be plentiful again? There is a youth hostel set high above the beach itself, behind the official car park. It is a long carry to the beach and not in any way normally suitable for kayak launching. The beach gives good surf though. Boulders and a dyke called the Long Causeway obstruct the E end. The rocky islets E of the beach towards Islandoo at D038-457 are NT and give good sport in the right conditions.</p>\n",

The rats on the island were exterminated by 1970 and it again became an important nesting site for Puffin and Cormorant. The large numbers of the latter indicate healthy fish stocks in the rivers of the NE coast. The island is flat topped with steep cliffs on all sides, essentially a large sea stack. There is a strong eddy between the island and Larry Bane Head at D049-452. The power of the eddy gives only a hint of the strength of the tide races in the main current on the N side. Landing Landing can be made at two points. On the N of the island is an obvious bay. A boulder beach at the head of the bay gives access to a corrie-shaped area whose southern side is a narrow ridge linking the higher points of the SW and NE sides. The climb from the boulder beach is firstly on easy grassy slopes but then onto steeper rock. An exposed climb leads onto high grassy slopes. The climb should not be underestimated as the rock is loose and the slope steep. A second landing, with easier access and support holds, is located on the SE corner. SPA Cormorant</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Carrickarede Island</strong> D062-449          Sheet 5 Carrickarede Island is about 2<em>km</em> E of Ballintoy Harbour and anyone visiting the area will be directed here. It is owned by the National Trust. It can be visited by land across its famous rope bridge, in place throughout the year, once used to serve salmon fishermen. Great bravery is required.  Far easier sometimes to visit by sea. The tide race off the NW corner is powerful, but can often be avoided by going under the rope bridge. The sand bar here is covered on the top two thirds of the tide. The rock strata is interesting, giving good nest sites for Kittiwake, Razorbill and Guillemot. There is a wonderful cave on the outside, visible only from the sea. <strong>Carrickarede to Ballycastle</strong> The cliff scenery now becomes quite majestic. The small wooded area at Port More is very unusual. Buzzards are common hereabouts. Landing may be had by an old winch on the W side of a forest. It is possible to escape here, but it is a long scramble to the nearest road. Watch for the splendid through-cave in Kinbane Head at D088-438. Tides set strongly at the head, and a very defined line separates the eddy from the flow. This is an excellent teaching area. Landing is possible on the W side of the head. A long steep path leads up the cliff to a car park on the E side. Nice cliffs join Kinbane Head to Ballycastle, with dramatic caves. The cliff structure hereabouts is liable to rock fall, the slips evident by lack of vegetation. One such is directly above an inviting cave entrance, so do take care. Ballycastle has a number of options for landing. The large breakwater has a concrete slip. The old pier has a slipway beside it. Car parking abounds, except in summer congestion. There is also a car park at the E end of the beach at D132-416 by Pans Rocks. <strong>Rathlin Island</strong> Chart 2798 covers the general area, as does OSNI Sheet 5. The information in the Pilot and the Sailing Directions is essential on this challenging section of coastline. Rathlin lies just over 10<em>km</em> N of Ballycastle, where there is a good embarkation place at the pier at D122-415. The island is served by regular ferry, and boasts a stable population. Most of the habitation and services are at Church Bay. Camping with water and toilets is possible amongst old caravans at D148-506, just S of the harbour. There is a hostel in the Old Manor House at the harbour, and some guest houses, the most convenient of which is just beside the large pier at D147-510. More remote camping spots can be had along the shore by Rue Point at D151-473 and along the E coast in the many secluded bays. Camping is convenient at Portawillin at D161-512 where there is a small pier with steps. The rest of the island is generally steep with cliffs towering above boulder beaches and landing is impossible or uninviting except in an emergency. The island, steeped in history, has a distinct character all its own. Wallace Clark’s book ‘Rathlin – Disputed Island’ gives a lot of information about its history from the earliest settlers to modern times. In earliest times porcellainite, or flint (as in stone age axes) was mined here and exported. The island was successively conquered and reconquered by the Vikings, Scots, Normans and the English. Most famously, it was litigated over between Ireland and Scotland, and found to be Irish because there were no snakes (Saint Patrick is said to have banished all snakes from Ireland in the 5<sup>th</sup> Century). Circumnavigation For the sea canoeist, this is one of the most committing of paddles, which is best done clockwise as the shape of the island sets up eddies to one’s advantage. The E side is the only part where progress could be made against the tide. The island is ‘L’ shaped and at each of the headlands there are major tide races, which are always active except at slack water, though it is generally possible to stay inshore and avoid their full force. The MacDonnell Race at the NE corner is particularly fearsome. The cliffs on the N side are high and dark and the feeling of exposure is greatest here. There are caves in the NE corner near the E lighthouse, the most famous of which is said to have been used by Robert the Bruce, where he met his spider. The S facing cliffs W of Church Bay are chalk overlaid with basalt, and very picturesque. There are some interesting shapes and stacks as one nears the W end of the island. There is an old pier at D102-509 in Cooraghy Bay, which gives a chance of a rest before tackling the committing part of the paddle. SPA Peregrine, Guillemot, Razorbill. The island, and the NE corner of Ireland generally, is splendidly situated for passage migrants in spring and autumn. Puffin, Buzzard and Eider are amongst the birds abounding in summer. A large colony of Common Seal may be found in Mill Bay, just S of the main harbour. Rathlin mice are the biggest in Ireland. Tides and embarkation The most obvious embarkation place is from Ballycastle. The tides in Rathlin Sound reach 6kns so the only time to make the crossing is on slack water (HW/LW Belfast). Start half an hour to an hour beforehand. Read the Irish Coast Pilot and study the hour-by-hour tidal chartlets the Sailing Directions of the Irish Cruising Club, North and East Coasts volume. Refer also to the Admiralty Tidal Stream Atlas for the Firth of Clyde and Approaches, NP222. Southwest of Rue Point at D152-473, the overfall <em>Slough-na-more</em> is most dangerous for an hour from 1:30 after Belfast HW. The flow on the north side of the island is always easterly due to an eddy on the ebb. An alternative is to embark from Dunseverick Harbour at D000-445 or Ballintoy Harbour at D038-456 on the last couple of hours of the flood and to come back six hours later on the last of the ebb.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Rathlin Sound</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"173\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">5:30 before Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">6kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">0:30 before Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">6kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>HW Rathlin and Ballycastle is 4:45 before Belfast in springs and 2 hours before in neaps.

The strand all along Ballycastle Bay shelves steeply, and any swell produces powerful dumping waves onto the coarse sandy beach. The tides are powerful close inshore, and with rain, the outflow from the river by the harbour gives a good indication of what is happening. The shore from Pans Rock at D133-417 to Murlough Bay 6<em>km</em> E is unrepentant. Initially there are large boulders after a cable or so. There is but the one landing, at Carric_km_ore at D164-427, the most secluded campsite in Northern Ireland. Around Fair Head, the tide races, off big boulders without shelter, backed by enormous climbing cliffs. There can be vicious downdraughts from winds from the S. Fierce tide races may be expected, and even the eddies close inshore are vicious. These cliffs were discovered for climbers by a sea kayaker on passage, Keith Britton. In 1964, Geoff Earnshaw and Calvert Moore put up the first climb – Earnshaw’s Chimney. By 2003, there were 363 routes at Fair Head cliffs, the finest in the land, bar none. This was the first recorded of many such interactions between these symbiotic outdoor pursuits, kayaking and climbing. Murlough Bay requires landing onto the rocks, but is sheltered, near the bottom of the NT car park. At LW a beach appears E of the cottages. The road here is private, but there is a natural ‘slipway’ at the cottages which allows easier access or egress, capable of being used without any bother from the cottage. Eastwards, the shoreline changes to steep and unstable grass slopes, intermingled with loose cliff and scree. There is a small landing E of Torr Head at D234-408. Have a look at the interesting stone shelter in the mouth of the cave. The local fishermen are particularly informative. Have a fair tide hereabouts, or suffer. The coastline S is much the same, steep grass eroded to provide exposed rock on the shore. The lack of distinct features makes judging progress difficult. There are some pleasant shingle beaches N of Cushendun. At Cushendun, land at the S end where a lane gives access to a car park, near the outflow of the Glendun River at D251-334. There is a paying campsite up in the village, too far away to be convenient. The coastline S to Cushendall is similar.

The West Maiden is also known as the Northern Rock, its lighthouse is called the West Tower. The East Maiden is known as the Southern Rock and holds the East Tower. Both were active lighthouses until the West Maiden was abandoned in 1903. The East Tower was modernised, automated and went electric in 1977. Embarkation The nearest is from a large car park with a slipway and access to a small shingle beach at D378-080 between Ballygalley and Ballygalley Head. There is also embarkation at Portmuck D460-024 on Island Magee which has good launching,good carpark and toilets.From here though there is the need to exercise great caution as it will be necessary to cross the Larne  shipping channel which is used by a “fast” ferry in summer months and conventional ferries throughout the year. Local paddlers tend to prefer the Port Muck embarkation and normally try to go out  about one and half hours before LW Belfast and return after the tide has turned. Shipping: The safest route to the island means staying N of Ballygalley Head. The port of Larne just S is busy with very fast cross channel ferries and shipping. Most take a line from Larne to Scotland that passes S of the Maidens, but some do pass N and then inside the Maidens when awaiting berthing space in Larne.</p>\n",

The island is interesting and has a nice mixture of wilderness habitats. Coastal grasses dominate the central part and the island rises steeply from W to E. There is a beach of mixed sand and shingle on its western side and a rocky bar extends shorewards off its southern point. This dries and is a problem for kayakers attempting to pass inside, especially at LW, when it is possible to walk out to the island. The island increases in height on its eastern flank to give quite attractive steep basalt sea cliffs and holds breeding populations of Puffin, Kittiwake, Razorbill, Black Guillemot and Guillemot. Three small rocky stacks lie off the northern end. The Ulster Wildlife Trust owns the island and information signs on the mainland do not encourage visitors. A strong tide race runs off the southern end of Muck at about 5/6 knots and can produce some great standing waves and broken water. Muck Island is off Island Magee which, despite its name, is not an island. However, it does have some excellent paddling, particularly in the section known locally as ‘The Gobbins’. The best part starts after Heddles Port at D479-991 and continues to Hills Port at D485-972. It boasted a great Victorian walkway, the remains of which are still visible from the sea.

It shelters the harbour at Groomsport, enabling a couple of dozen moorings in its lee.  A remarkable reef, it is submerged by the highest tides, and there is no grass or greenery of any kind.  It is always separated from the shore by deep water.  Black Headed Gulls and Herring Gulls occupy different sections of it for roosting.  There are reports of Terns nesting.  Its claim to fame includes a Sooty Tern (called locally “Wideawake Tern” in Ascension Island where they spend the rest of the year) in summer 2005. Launch from the slipway at Cockle Island Sailing Club on the pier just SE (the pier is not shown on the OS). Groomsport is an unsatisfactory embarkation point for the Copelands because the tides are never right.  The ebb from Belfast Lough pushes E towards the islands while the ebb outside is pushing N away from them.  The flood in the Lough pushes away when outside it is pushing towards.  A slingshot from Donaghadee is far preferable, if it can be arranged. <strong>Copeland Islands</strong> Sheet 15 Embarkation Donaghadee is the logical embarkation point for a day trip to the Copeland Islands. There is access via ferry which allows time for wandering about Copeland Island itself. It seems to run in summer mongths only from the harbour. For kayaks, there is a small car park and slipway just W of the harbour at J588-803. Copeland Island is the innermost of the group, with Lighthouse Island next and Mew Island on the outside. Donaghadee Sound lies inside Copeland Island. Copeland Sound lies between Copeland Island and Light House Island. Given the strong tides, this is an excellent proficiency training and testing ground.

Fauna The islands are internationally important sites for breeding populations of Manx Shearwater and Arctic Tern and nationally important sites for breeding Mediterranean Gull, Common Gull and Eider Duck.  The Manx Shearwater colony on Copeland Islands holds more than 1.7% of the world population. The colony is in excess of four thousand pairs.  The rabbit populations on the islands play an important role in the breeding success of the Manx Shearwater as the latter mainly nest in the rabbit burrows that honeycomb the islands. Grazing by rabbits maintains a short sward, which is desirable for the fledglings. Copeland Island has an internationally important Arctic Tern colony, with some 550 pairs. The site now represents the largest colony for this species in Ireland. Mew Island has been an important tern colony in the past and it is hoped that positive management will encourage terns to become re-established.  The islands are the most important breeding sites in Northern Ireland for Common Gull with over 250 pairs present. Copeland has recently held Northern Ireland’s first successful breeding pair of Mediterranean Gull. The islands are home to a nationally important population of breeding Eider Duck. In total the three islands account for 14% of the Irish population. Non- breeding Eider form part of the nationally important population that occurs along the Outer Ards coast and Belfast Lough areas. Other breeding colonies of note include Black Guillemot, Water Rail and Stock Dove. The latter species has suffered a dramatic decline in Northern Ireland, but numbers have increased on Copeland with some 100 pairs now breeding. Breeding waders such as Lapwing and Snipe may be found further inland. Here the taller vegetation, interspersed with open areas, provides an ideal breeding habitat. Birds of prey favour the islands when the breeding season is over. Hen Harrier, Sparrowhawk, Buzzard, Kestrel, Merlin and Peregrine are all be seen regularly. Grey Seal and Common Seal can be found off the Copeland Islands in significant numbers. They utilise the off-shore islands and reefs as haul-outs and as pupping and mating sites.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Copeland Island</strong> J590-834           Sheet 15 The very beautiful Copeland Island is the largest island of the group at 2<em>km</em> by 1<em>km</em>.  It is also closest to the shore, lying 3<em>km</em> N of Donaghadee. There are seven holiday/summer homes on Copeland, and the island seems deserted all winter.  The island never had fuel of any kind, neither wood nor peat, all having to be imported. Bleak enough in winter, grassy, and bracken covered in parts.  It rises to 31m History Historically called Aran Island, the gaelic name was lost in early mediaeval times, when the Norse used the island as a trading base.  The modern <em>koopman</em> or older <em>kaupmann</em> means “merchant”, and <em>Kaupmannaeyjar</em> means “Merchants Isle”.  Both names were is use side by side until the 17<sup>th</sup>century when the Norse version won out.  Anglicised as Copman, this corrupted in time to the present Copeland.  A theory that the islands were named for William Coupeland, a Norman settler, has been debunked by distinguished local historian Peter Carr. The graveyard 200m from the landing at Chapel Bay is very old, the inscribed headstones dating back to at least 1742, pointing to a once thriving community.  Cleggs, Emersons and Wrights are popular names.  A 1930s newspaper reporter wrote that the island was neat as a new pin, the hedges cut and shaped, the garden walls whitewashed.  Careful of their property the islanders were said to have been neglectful of their perception of their culture.  Neither could the aging population explain island placenames, nor did they show interest.  The population was mostly evacuated in 1946. The very last to go, Frederick and Aise Clegg, moved to the mainland in 1953.  They died in 1964 and 1965 and were the last burials in the island graveyard. Landing Sandy beach landings are possible in Chapel Bay at J591-834 on the SW and the even more beautiful Deer Bay on the NE side at J596-838. In fact there are other perfectly adequate landing points, either side of the S tip, and elsewhere.  Port Dandy at J585-836 has a beach, and its sheltered water is a popular gin palace anchorage of a sunny summer afternoon.  Best altogether keep away from the main settlement areas, as island folk value privacy. Ask on the island for permission to camp. Flora and Fauna Grazed mainly by rabbits and sheep, the island is short grassed and pleasant to walk.  Two immature Golden Eagle were seen in April 2006, some Pheasant, and a Short Eared Owl.</p>\n",

The lighthouse (built in 1884) is reminiscent of an airport control tower. Apparently, this lighthouse was only automated in 1996, and until then the keepers even maintained a golf course for their entertainment! Landing is possible at the lighthouse jetty tucked into the channel, or into a cut in the NW, both deep-water landings. Before the lighthouse was built on Mew, a spectacular wreck was that of the ‘Enterprise’ in 1801. Then, in 1833, Alexander Graham Bell used a new fangled invention called a diving apparatus to retrieve its valuable cargo. A great tragedy was played out here on 31st January 1953 when the ferry ‘Princess Victoria’ got into trouble en route from Stranraer to Belfast in a severe NW gale. Heavy seas stove in the car deck doors, just after leaving the Scottish port. As the ferry slowly listed and began to sink, it drifted. The ‘Princess Victoria’ thought it was drifting down the Scottish coast, so the rescue services were sent to the wrong place. Only when the Copeland lighthouse was sighted was their correct position transmitted. The order was eventually given to abandon ship, and the life rafts were launched. The women and children were all in the first two rafts, both of which capsized. All drowned in sight of the men still on board. When the rescue services finally came on the scene, the seas were truly mountainous. Great heroism later merited several gallantry awards of the highest level available to non-military personnel. Captain Ferguson (brother of Harry Ferguson, inventor of the modern tractor) and his radio operator David Broadfoot stayed at their posts to the end and went down with the ship. 121 died. There were 44 survivors, all adult males. The same storm peaked in the North Sea that night. A combination of low pressure, a spring tide surge, and sustained NW winds raised the sea level more than 3m, flooding Holland over its dykes, and 1,600 were drowned. There have been issues with canoeists having BBQs on the island and leaving scorch marks on the grass areas.  This is a bird breeding island, and the gress is their home.  So it is important when landing on these islands to show respect and follow ”leave no trace” principles. <strong>Bangor to Strangford Lough</strong> Sheet 21 / Sheet 15 The paddling from Donaghadee at J691-802 to Ballyquintin Point at J624-454 at the mouth of Strangford Narrows – a distance of about 40<em>km</em> – is a straightforward but interesting enough piece of coastline. The Ards Peninsula has almost an island feel to it because of its remoteness by road and the ferry service which operates at the southern end at Portaferry. The coastline from Donaghadee to Ballyhalbert Point at J664-630 is less interesting than further S, being of shingle and sand beaches. Next comes Portavogie at J663-595, a busy fishing harbour often congested with trawlers. <strong>North Rocks</strong> Sheet 21           J674-561 North Rocks at J674-561 with its breeding Grey Seals, lies 3<em>km</em> SSE of Portavogie.   Consisting of two islets that stand no more than 1m above HW, this is Ireland’s most easterly landfall.   Landing at rocky coves to the NW and E is easy at LW and when conditions are calm.  At LW a decent ramble can be had among the deep rock pools and Cormorant nests.  Many ships have been lost here and the North Rocks beacon (an unlit 12m high tower 250<em>m</em> to the NW) gives a sense of maritime history. South Rock at J677-531 lies 2<em>km</em> offshore and 3<em>km</em> N of Kearney Point, and boasts the oldest standing wave swept lighthouse in Ireland (1797), Kilwarlin. The rocky shoreline of Kearney Point at J645-511 is owned by the National Trust and is a good place to go ‘rock pool peering’ for marine invertebrates such as Dog Whelks, Mussels, and Starfish. It is a very enjoyable day trip to catch the ebb tide from Strangford out to the mouth, then N to the Rocks, and back on the flood. There is a spit of land between the North Rocks and Ringboy Point at J650-574 to the WNW. Occasionally the sea can become steep and untidy here, particularly when the swell is against the tide.

In ecological terms it is unique and the jewel in Northern Ireland’s coastline. It has a great deal to offer sea canoeists at every level, from sheltered backwaters for introducing novices, to powerful tide races, overfalls and whirlpools for the more experienced at the narrow entrance, called the Narrows. The old name for Strangford was ‘Cuan’ (meaning safe harbour) but the Vikings renamed it Strangford or ‘The Violent Fjord’. SPA Arctic, Common and Sandwich Tern, Bar-tailed Godwit, Golden Plover,<em>kn</em>, Brent Goose, Redshank, Shelduck. Strangford is the premier autumn arrival site for the Brent Goose. Some remain on for the winter but most disperse to other sites throughout Ireland. There are 2 species of seal to be found around our coasts. They are the Common (or Harbour) Seal and the Grey Seal. They are quite distinctly different. The Common has a spaniel dog type of head and is considerably smaller than the Grey, which has a flat head with a large obvious nose. There are about 400 Common Seals and 80 Grey Seals in the lough. The Common Seal give birth in June and it is most entertaining to watch the antics of the pups from the quiet position of a sea kayak. The greys give birth in October and it is a rare and beautiful sight to see the white furry pups of these much larger seals. Chart 2156 and OS sheet 21 each covers the lough in detail. <strong>Angus Rock</strong> Sheet 21                       J610-453 Angus Rock is the first point of note entering the Narrows, near the mouth. It is just a rock, virtually covered at HW, but on it stands a small lighthouse, white with an unusual red top band. At HW, there is just a concrete ramp proud of the water which can take a few kayaks at picnic time. At lower water, quite an extensive area of rock gets exposed. This is an important waystop, a most useful journey breaker on local day trips. There are overfalls and broken water around Angus Rock, both on the flood and ebb tide. See the tidal stream atlas for details. On spring tides, from the 1st to 3rd hour of the ebb, an interesting grade 2 rapid occurs on the N side of the Angus Rock. This can get up to about a grade 3 with a diagonal stopper during very big equinoctial springs. There is a drop in sea level across the rocks of about 3 feet and it is possible to get good surfing on the stopper wave. On the last hour of the ebb, an enjoyable set of waves often form, again on the N side of the Angus Rock, where you can join the seals for some surfing. On the flood tide, again just N of the Rock, another small set of overfalls is formed. There is an obvious drop in the sea level followed by small boils and whirlpools. <strong>The Narrows</strong> Sheet 21 Strangford Lough covers 150<em>km</em><sup>2</sup> of sea and contains 1650 million m<sup>3</sup> of sea water at high tide. HW at Portaferry is at least 2 hours later than at the mouth of the Narrows. It takes approximately 350 million m<sup>3</sup> (or tonnes) of water to fill the lough from LW to HW. All this water can only get into the lough by passing through the Narrows which is 9<em>km</em> long and at its narrowest point, only 600m wide. Hence a vast river of water rushes through at speeds of up to 7.5<em>kn</em>. Embarkation Points Where to put in and out depends entirely on the tidal flow at the time, and the main attraction of the expedition.  For the deep water surfing at the mouth, there are a number of choices along the W side from Ballyhornan as far up as Kilclief, to taste.  For the Routen Wheel approach so as to go home downstream, and for small groups that means just about anywhere, as the roads each side are favourable. Tides The tide begins almost simultaneously throughout the Narrows at the following times.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Strangford Narrows</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">3:30 before Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">7.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:30 after Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">7.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Passage is straightforward and fairly safe on the flood. However, during the ebb, a heavy breaking sea can be encountered. This is particularly dangerous with any form of wind from the south/southeast/east creating a swell. Huge breaking seas are generated. For the more experienced and confident only, excellent deep-water surf waves are formed at the entrance, where it is advisable to play only on the last hour or two of the ebb. Routen Wheel The next point of interest is the Routen Wheel, just SW of Rue Point. The Wheel is on the E side of the channel. It is quite easy to avoid by closely hugging the coast along the E side. A good viewing point is from the wee island called Isle O’Valla at J593-488. The Wheel is characterised by short-lived but heavy and violent boils, whirlpools and stoppers. It is caused by an underwater ridge of rock only 4.6m below the surface, rising suddenly either side from 18m below, sticking diagonally out from the shallower E side of the main channel into the main flow. The NE/SW ridge that creates the Wheel is situated along a line 200<em>m</em> SW of Rue Point at J597-487 to J599-489. This is no ordinary rapid. A boil forms, then another beside it swivelling the other way, and soon a whirlpool forms on the boundary. Admire it as pretty, but then you are in it, sinking ever lower, pointing upstream, to the side, down again, then the whirlpool stops and away you go again. Paddling back up through the Wheel is an experience too as you try to read the water, the way boils are pushing and so on. A good eddy exists S of Rue Point on the E side, as far as Gowland Rock at J603-485, so that a number of runs of the Wheel can be enjoyed. The Wheel occurs during both the flood and ebb tide although it tends to be more violent during the ebb. The turbulence lasts for about 400m and any capsises can easily be dealt with beyond the turbulence. Rescues need to be swift as the speed of the current reaches 7.5<em>kn</em>. It is safer to play during the flood. Tidal Electricity A first for Ireland and the biggest by far in Europe, just 1<em>km</em> NNW of the Routen Wheel lies SeaGen at J599-494, the world’s only commercially viable underwater electricity generator.  SeaGen is a prototype wind farm for tidal races.  With twin huge blades of 16m either side of a central pillar, the propellers catch a massive 400<em>m</em>.sq of passing water.  300<em>m</em>.sq is required for profitability, and most other designs are well short of the mark.  The blades about turn every slack water so as not to lose a minutes effort, and they can be raised for easy maintenance.   Boats including kayaks may pass by with impunity as the blades are well below the surface, and no seals are as yet known to have suffered any trauma.  The pillar supporting the generator is round, which is a bad shape for downstream turbulence and consequent environmental worries, but the whole project including the impact of its water turbulence is being closely monitored, and the whole project will be reviewed after a few years. There is a rapid beside a beacon to one side, Gowland Rock at J603-485, where a surf wave forms, just like on a river. The area around here is used a lot by seals to haul out on the rocks. Care should be taken not to disturb them from their haul outs as it can cause injury. One of the greatest dangers on the Narrows is the potential for being run down by the ferry which runs between Strangford and Portaferry. This ferry has to contend with a 6<em>kn</em> tide and does a remarkably efficient ‘ferry glide’ across the flow. The Captain does not appreciate having to contend with dodging canoeists as well. The ferry departs Strangford on the hour and half hour and departs Portaferry every quarter past and quarter to the hour. The crossing time is about 5 minutes. ‘Exploris’, an excellent aquarium, is situated within a minute’s walk from the main slip at Portaferry and is well worth a visit as it has displays of the marine wildlife of the lough and the Irish Sea. Another place well worth a visit is the Barn at Castleward, owned by the National Trust, in Castleward Bay at J575-497. Access from the water is best gained during HW as there are extensive mud flats in the bay. The Barn has excellent audio visual displays of the marine wildlife, particularly the bird and mammal life found in the lough. They also have a number of very good videos on the wildlife of the lough. Entry is free. Audley’s Castle, built in the 16th Century, lies on the W side of the Narrows about 1<em>km</em> N of Strangford and is worth a visit. It is possible to land at the little beach and jetty beside it at J589-501 and climb to the top where there is an excellent view of the Narrows and the towns of Portaferry and Strangford. <strong>Inner Strangford Lough</strong> Sheet 21 Embarkation Points For such a large area, embarkation points are few enough.  There are few on the E side the main ones being a public Kircubbin J598-630 and in the Narrows at Portaferry itself at J594-507 – the slip N of the marina with reasonably good car parkingthe main towns in the Narrows.  .  The options include :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Portaferry J594-507 – the slip N of the marina with reasonably good car parking,</li>\n<li>Strangford J589-497 – the slip at to the S of the ferry terminal with good car parking,</li>\n<li>Killyleagh J528-520 – the slip at the sailing club, in small discreet numbers.If access difficulties, there are other places along the shore, closer to town.</li>\n<li><p>Ringhaddy J526-585 – limited parking.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Ballydorn Lightship J526-624 – a little quay on the S side of Hen Island, to one side of the ship, and which apparently belongs to the yacht club.  The use of this should be discreet and in small numbers.  The yacht club may also be a possibility at J524-627.  There is also a splendid off-season campsite in a parking lot with toilets at J523-625, but beware extensive drying mudflats out front.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Tides Inside the lough, the tidal strength decreases from 6kn between Strangford and Portaferry to 4kn at Ballyhenry Island at J575-520, 2km northwest, as the water disperses into the lough. It further reduces to about 1.5kn at Dunnyneill Islands at J547-539, a further 3km northwest. The E coast of the lough has a lot less of interest to the canoeist than the W due to the lack of islands etc. However, at ‘The Dorn’ at J593-568, there is a reasonable tidal flow from an enclosed bay of up to 2.5<em>kn</em>, especially on the ebb and a spectacular marine waterfall about an hour to two after high water. Chapel Island at J562-513 and Jackdaw Island at J557-510 are the first to be reached when paddling W out of the Narrows. In the spring, Jackdaw is an important nesting site for terns and should be avoided. Many of the islands have large colonies of Irish Hares which can often be seen running along the beach. In the SW corner, Salt Island at J532-500 lies within the Quoile Estuary, and is one of the many islands owned by the National Trust. The Trust has redeveloped a bothy on the SE side of Salt which is an absolutely superb facility for the canoeist looking for a bit more comfort than a tent. The Bothy sleeeps 12, has a woodburning stove, running water and a couple of WCs. Book through the NT.  Camping is also permitted on Salt Island, both at the bothy and at the bay on the west side of the island. To the SW of Salt Island lies the Slaney River where St. Patrick landed in 432 A.D. He must have landed here during HW or he would have had to slog through the stinking mud to reach the shore. He went to Salt and was confronted by the local Chieftain who became Patrick’s first convert to Christianity in Ireland. Heading N from the barrage which protects Downpatrick from tidal flooding, lies Gibbs Island at J509-496 which is one of the few islands within the lough to have trees. There are some mature Scots Pines on Gibbs. Further N, the first major island outside the Quoile estuary is Island Taggart at J533-545. This is one of the largest islands in the lough and used to support two small farms. These belong to the National Trust and are well worth a visit as they show what life on the island was like. Look out for the coffin in the barn! They were also used for the film ‘December Bride’, a story of life in the area in the early 1900s, written by Sam Hanna Bell and there was even a film starring Ciaran Hinds. Foxes, badgers and otters are all resident on Taggart, meriting an overnight camp and exploration. Camping is permitted and most suitable on th north east corner at J536-554. The W side of the lough is a fascinating maze of submerged drumlin hills forming over 100 islands and rock pladdies.  Between Taggart and Mahee Island at J530-636, almost 10<em>km</em> N, lie the ‘basket of eggs’ – dozens of little islands which are excellent for night navigation as they are sheltered and safe. Tides can run at about 1-2<em>kn</em> during springs in a N/S direction between some of the islands and particularly through Ringhaddy Sound at J537-582. Tides Tides can run at about 1-2kn during springs in a north/south direction between some of the islands and particularly through Ringhaddy Sound at J537-582. Pawle Island at J543-571 is a lovely spot for lunch.  There is an old house in the SW tip with the remains of a slip built through the rocks on the beach. From the top of the hill behind the house there is a lovely panoramic view of the S half of Strangford. Islandmore is now inhabited all the year round.  The ‘Blue Cabin’ on the W side of Islandmore at J538-584 is owned and lived in by Michael Faulkner (son of the last prime minister of Northern Ireland – Brian Faulkner) and his wife, the artist, Lynn McGreggor.  The house was always in the Faulkner family but got sold.  Then in the last years of his life, Brian met its then owner when on holidays in the W of Ireland, and bought it back.  It became the family holiday home.  Michael and Lynn moved there after their business went bust, and they fancied starting over in “the good life”.  The house is a former prisoner of war hut from the Isle of Man, that housed German soldiers in the Great War.  It was shipped to Northern Ireland in 1921 after all the huts were auctioned off.  The Blue Cabin is thought to be the only one still intact, no water, no electricity, “period”. Their remote house and its owners are the subject of books, television programs, and endless internet activity.  Nothing is reliably known about their tolerance for visitors, if any. Between Islandmore and Ringhaddy lies the interesting wreck of the “<em>Alastor</em>” in 10 – 15<em>m</em> maximum depth.  She went down in 1946 as a result of an accidental fire on board, but is still good for diving.  She was at the time wrongly identified as the “<em>Alisdair</em>” and forgotten.  Then in April 2004 QUBSAC adopted her as the subject of an experiment to test the efficiency of a new underwater measuring tape.  The results were all over the place, to the extent they had to conclude there was some mistake.  The <em>Alastor</em> was eventually correctly identified.  Until commandeered in WW2 by the Royal Navy for active service, it had been the pleasure yacht of Sir Thomas Sopwith who designed the Sopwith Camel bi-plane of the Great War and the Hawker Hurricane of WW2 (that actually won the Battle of Briton, and not its iconic cousin the Spitfire – the Hurricane being faster than the Mescherschmitt 109, speed then as now being everything).  Later the <em>Alastor</em> belonged to the Shelley family (as in Percy Bysshe, composer of Ozymandias, and Mary Shelley inventor of Frankenstein).  Now the wreck belongs to the Faulkeners of Islandmore. Green Island Rock at J545-602 is a haul out for Common Seal and is very accessible to allow a group of novices to experience the observation of seals in their habitat. Care should be however be taken to avoid any disturbance. To the W and N of Rainey Island at J527-630, there are two channels where the tide runs either side of the island at up to 5<em>kn</em> in its rush to fill or empty Reagh Bay to the NW. Again, this is an excellent area for introducing novices to moving water. HW in the area is at approximately HW Dover +0220. Mahee Island has an early Celtic Monastery on the W side, and the island is definitely worth a visit to walk round the monastic ruins. The monks are believed to have occupied the area from the 5th to the 10th Centuries. There is a great view from the top of the monastery hill.  Recently there was a discovery of early Celtic fish traps in the N facing cove on the W side J525-637 (where easiest to land), but these are only visible at LW. The area NW of Mahee Island holds little of interest to the canoeist, unless you’re into mud wrestling in a big way, as large expanses of mudflats cover the area. The NW mudflats do support vast numbers of waders. During the winter, the statistics of birds using the lough demonstrates the international importance of Strangford as a wildlife sanctuary: Swans 290+ Geese 13,500+ (including 1,300 Pale-bellied Brent Geese, more than 75% of the world population) Ducks 9,000+ Waders      50,000+ Chapel Island – J555-675.  There are ruins of an old church in this island and it is a bird sanctuary.  It is accessible at all tides and has a remote feel although close to the E shore.  It is owned by the NT and shouldn’t be visited in the breeding season. The lough has areas renowned for their beauty or scientific importance and legislation protects this valuable and unique area. Access is unrestricted in the lough and conservationists rely heavily on the goodwill of recreational users. The National Trust has produced ‘The Castaways Code’ and map for those using the lough for recreational boating. This should be consulted before paddling in the lough during the nesting season (April-June) and the islands marked ‘Birds Welcome’ should be avoided.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Guns Island</strong> J596-415           Sheet 21 Guns Island lies 2<em>km</em> S of the entrance to Strangford Lough. At extreme LW springs, it is possible to walk or wade across to the island from the beach at Ballyhornan. What looks suspiciously like an active sewage outlet pours into the sea just S of the village. Most of the time, a reasonably strong tide runs between Guns Island and the mainland – up to 2<em>kn</em>. Landing is always possible on one side or the other of the sandy spit stretching NW of the island. At LW, or in search of shelter, landings may be had elsewhere in small coves, particularly halfway down the W side. There is a lovely old stone navigation marker painted white on the SE tip. Beside it lies the remains of an old ruined church. Thick grass covers the island. Very attractive spot. Fauna The SE side of Guns Island is a mass of nesting Kittiwake, Guillemot and Cormorant on the cliff ledges and paddlers should keep a reasonable distance offshore to avoid disturbance during the nesting season (April-June). The N side is favoured by a large colony of gulls that nest on the tussock grass just above the shore. <strong>Strangford Lough to Carlingford Lough</strong> Sheet 21/Sheet 29 Killard Point at J613-435, a National Nature Reserve, is well worth a visit, especially in June to see the abundance of butterflies and wild flowers growing on the sand dunes. Among these can be found the beautiful Bee Orchid, Spotted Orchid, Wild Thyme and Yellow Rattle. Butterflies include the Common Blue, Small Heath and Meadow Brown. The 14<em>km</em> from the entrance of Strangford Lough to St.John’s Point is a lovely paddle along small cliffs and a rocky shore of siltstones and shales believed to be formed during the Silurian period, 435 million years ago. This area is known as the Lecale and shortly after the last ice age would have been a large island with the sea connecting Dundrum inner bay with Strangford Lough. Banderg Bay at J605-432 followed by Ballyhornan Bay at J594-420, are pleasant sandy beaches with clay cliffs behind, where there are nesting Fulmar. Never disturb these birds at their nest as they have the ability to douse you with an extremely evil smelling mucus from their nostrils which sticks better than any glue known to man! Portnacoo at J589-406, 200m SW of the southern tip of Guns Island, has a 2m wide gap in the rocks which opens out into a cove with a 15m wide pebbly peach, an ideal lunch stop. At Legnaboe, on the mainland about 600<em>m</em> S of the southern tip of Guns Island, there is a narrow sea cave which appears safe to enter at all states of the tide, provided there is little swell. Along this piece of coast lie the villages of Ardglass at J563-373 and Killough at J540-363. Although Killough was an important fishing port, the harbour is now derelict, whilst Ardglass has taken over as a principal fishing port, famous for its herrings, pronounced locally as ‘hearns’. A new marina has been built at Ardglass and there is easy access to the sea from both Killough and Ardglass with a good slip and carparking on the harbour at Ardglass. SPA Brent Goose (Killough Harbour) From St. John’s Point at J526-333 to Newcastle (a distance of 15<em>km</em> as the crow flies or as the canoeist paddles), the scenery is dominated by the beach and sand dune systems of Murlough National Nature Reserve (NNR). Within the inner bay at Dundrum, there is a causeway and bridge at J402-356. This connects the farms and houses within Murlough NNR to the main Dundrum to Newcastle road. The tide flows through this bridge at up to 6<em>kn</em> on springs in its rush to fill or empty the southern half of the inner bay. Good eddies are created by the bridge stanchion and this is used almost constantly at HW by local paddlers to teach and practise moving water techniques. HW at the bridge is +0030 HW Dover. The best fun is to be had during springs. This occurs every second weekend when the tide is usable from approx. 1000hrs until 1500hrs, HW being around midday. During the ebb from Dundrum inner bay, tremendous deep water surfing waves can be formed at the entrance if there is even a little swell from the S or E. However, once the tide has finished ebbing, the only practical course of action is to paddle to Newcastle 5<em>km</em> away as the inner bay will be dry. For 2<em>km</em> to the S and 3<em>km</em> to the N of the entrance to Dundrum inner bay, care must be taken due to the rifle range at the army camp at Ballykinler. There are 3 yellow marker buoys marked DZ and the paddler should keep to the seaward side of these when the red flag (day) or red lights (night) are visible over the base just N of the entrance to the inner bay. However, tracers have been sighted by local canoeists doing a night paddle from St.John’s Point to Newcastle that would indicate that they could travel more than 2<em>km</em> beyond these buoys. The Coastguard should be contacted before paddling this section of coast. The tides along this section of coast to St.John’s Point are weak. A trip from St.John’s Point to Newcastle is a very popular paddle on a good moonlit night as you have the lighthouse flashing behind you, the twinkling lights of Newcastle to aim for and the foreboding outline of the Mournes dominating the paddle. Newcastle is very much the seaside holiday tourist town and is usually thronged between Easter and September, especially at weekends. However, good access to the beach exists from various car parks in the town. Access is also available from the harbour where there is very limited parking. It should be noted that this dries out at low water. Access may still be gained over the wall to the stony beach to the S of the harbour at J382-296. A sewage outfall pipe lies about 1 cable offshore to the S of the harbour and, although Newcastle’s sewage works are meant to be one of the most sophisticated in the UK, the area surrounding the pipe should be well avoided! During S or E winds, good surfing can be had at the beach and a good break exists at the mouth of the harbour at lower water. During particularly strong winds, i.e. above Force 6, the surf is very broken and you can find yourself 500m offshore still looking for a way out through the soup. Having said that, this must be one of the most picturesque places to surf – ‘Where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea’. The scenery of the Mourne Mountains dominates the 25<em>km</em> from Newcastle to Cranfield Point at J270-099 on the northern side of the entrance of Carlingford Lough. It is made up of rocky beaches and small cliffs, a relic from the ice age that shaped the panorama of the Mourne scenery more than 10,000 years ago. From Newcastle to Bloody Bridge at J389-269, the coastline is interesting. The small cliff scenery provides enjoyable rock dodging, particularly at high water, when many of the caves and channels become more accessible. The National Trust owns the section of coast between Bloody Bridge and the mouth of the Crock Horn Stream below Ballagh Bridge, 2<em>km</em> S at J388-249. After that, there is good access to the sea at Glassdrumman Port at J381-222, famous with geographers for the obvious series of easily identified raised beaches and a very pleasant little sandy beach from which to launch or enjoy your lunch. There are a number of small but enjoyable caves in the area, one of which has a blowhole at the top. There are also two bigger caves, one of which involves a 50<em>m</em> squeeze, where hands are needed to get through. This cave is not obvious from the sea but it can be found with careful exploring and it’s worth going through, especially in a plastic boat! The other large cave has a small rocky beach at the back and if there isn’t much swell, it’s good fun landing and exploring on up the cave. A short trip from Newcastle to Bloody Bridge and back is ideal for introducing novices to spectacular sea canoeing. The next principal port is Annalong which has a small harbour at J378-197, used mainly by small craft engaged in creeling (laying lobster pots). Further along the coast is a small rock called Selk Island at J359-176, which appropriately enough has a small colony of Common Seal. Then, passing Lee Stone Point at J334-144, the large granite boulder (another relic of the ice age known as an erratic) is an obvious feature. The fishing port of Kilkeel lies 6<em>km</em> short of Cranfield Point. This is one of Northern Ireland’s busiest fishing ports with up to 70 boats using the harbour at J317-140. <strong>County Louth</strong> <strong>Carlingford Lough</strong> Carlingford Lough is the most dramatic sea lough on the E coast of Ireland, almost a fiord, with the Mourne Mountains to the N and the craggy Carlingford Mountains to the S. It has great variation, from pleasant, sheltered paddling within the lough to big races and overfalls at its mouth. The S side of the lough is in the Republic of Ireland while the N side is in Northern Ireland. Up until (reputedly) the 1950’s, a lucrative smuggling trade ran between Greencastle and Carlingford harbours. The tidal streams within the lough are weak and a pleasant and undemanding crossing can be made from Killowen or Rostrevor Quays to Carlingford village. However, during strong WNW winds, squalls funnel down from the hills around Rostrevor and cause little cyclones and mini tornadoes on the surface. These are known locally as ‘Kettles’ as the water appears to boil and steam to rise. The Newry Canal can be accessed on the S side of the lough beyond Warrenpoint at J108-207. This is really only practicable during HW as the area surrounding the access to the canal dries to extensive mudflats. There are reports that the canal is going to be reopened. The canal goes to Lough Neagh but a passage, even by canoe, is exceptionally difficult, as it is heavily overgrown and silted. SPA Common and Sandwich Tern, Brent Goose</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Blockhouse Island</strong> J255-096           Sheet 29 Blockhouse Island (a guano pile in springtime) lies between Sheep Rock and Haulbowline Lighthouse, is bigger than either but is not named on the OS map. This small rocky islet guards the entrance to Carlingford Lough. A military building was erected here in 1602, now entirely ruined, and was known as Carlingford Fort. The island is small and worthwhile mainly as a waypoint on tour, as landing may always be had onto stormbeaches on the W or slabby limestone on the E side. The lighthouse just to the E at J260-096 is 20m high with a white light flashing three times every ten seconds and an ancillary red light lower down continuously flashing. Landing at the lighthouse is not permitted and anyway can only be achieved in calm conditions. The main channel into the lough passes to the N of the island, where one must avoid commercial shipping. Navigation in the lough is very buoyage orientated so consider using Chart 2800. Embark on the S side of the lough from Greenore or from the pretty Carlingford Harbour. The best launching in Greenore is from behind the pier at J225-107, and in Carlingford launch just outside the E pier at J194-118, as the silted harbour exposes black mud at the bottom of the tide. On the Northern Ireland side, launch from Greencastle Point at J242-117, or a small car park and beach at J263-107, between Soldiers Point and Cranfield Point. Tides Tides run strongly in the lough entrance near the island, where the ebb and flow start with local HW and LW, which are much the same as Dublin, especially in the dredged channels E &amp; N of the island, where 5kn can be experienced.  On the other hand, on-shore winds on the ebb throw up a fearsome sea state. The ebb tide runs at 3.5<em>kn</em> in springs in the dredged channels. The flow follows the main dredged channels except for an eddy on the flood on the E side of Blockhouse Island. Good overfalls and races occur during both the flood and the ebb around the Haulbowline Lighthouse. The most pleasant and relatively safe playing in these overfalls is on the flood tide. The area is regularly used by local clubs and centres for rough water training. <strong>The East Coast</strong> <strong>Greenore Point to Carnsore Point</strong> <strong>County Dublin</strong> <strong>Islands off Skerries</strong> A group of three low-lying islands lie just off the coast at Skerries, with ‘The Rock’ further off. Taken together they form an interesting day trip with good wildlife interest. They are listed as areas of Scientific Interest by Duchás with SPA status. Camping is possible, but no water is available. The presence of a healthy population of rats on the inner islands may discourage an overnight. Rugged Rockabill further out is a lighthouse island rock. SPA Short-eared Owl (up to 7 in winter), Golden Plover, and Common, Sandwich and Roseate Tern. Embarkation The most convenient embarkation place is at the slipway beside the RNLI building at the pier in Skerries, where parking is generally convenient at O255-612, but not for larger groups especially in summer. Otherwise its Pay&amp;Display or search.  Do not, under any circumstances, block the access to or interfere with the operation of the lifeboat station, or of the working pier. Launching may also be had less conveniently from the E facing South Strand, but only at HW to avoid a long carry. The main catch at Skerries is prawn and shrimp. Accordingly, the local fishermen are benignly disposed to seals, which do not catch either. Seals are plentiful hereabouts. Tides The flows flood generally north and ebb south.

The accuracy as to whether St. Patrick ever landed here is a source of some debate. This is the jumping off point for Rockabill. Land easily at a sheltered storm beach, just W of the S tip, in almost any conditions. Landing is also possible at higher tides at a shingle cove just further E. There is a further landing place on the N facing shore near a ruined house and marked by two metal poles – a small beachlet among the rocks, for when southerlies prevail. There is the ruin of an Early Christian Church and a small monastery, which dates back to Viking times. It was important enough to merit a synod being held in 1148 in which fifteen bishops, two hundred priests, and several other clergy assisted. The church towards the E tip is still very much worth the visit. St Patrick’s Island has an internationally important breeding population of Cormorants (2001 Census) of 550 pairs. There are breeding gulls, Shags and Fulmars in summer, while geese, ducks and waders provide winter interest. There is a colony of 70-80 Grey Seals, especially during winter. The NE and eastern sides of the island catch the full ebb tide over a rocky underwater reef. Overfalls can develop, especially in S/SE winds against a spring ebb tide.

Landing Landing on Lighthouse Island is in the sound between the two islands onto a small pier with steps or onto rocks to the side, depending on circumstances.

Rush Harbour at O274-543 is almost as near, and in calm conditions is handiest on the ebbing tide.

The best plan for a day trip is a slingshot from Loughshinny (excellent parking), lunching at the island during the LW slack. Landing The island is privately owned by the Revelstoke family and no landing should take place. This is particularly true of the W side of the island where the main harbour and housing is situated. The owners value their privacy, the welfare of the nesting wild bird population, and the health of their most unusual domesticated animal population, marsupials included. If in distress, at least stay below the HW line and out of sight. There are also some useful waystops on the circumnavigation of Lambay. There are two satisfactory beaches on the N side, just E of the NW point, one tucked into the point itself facing E at O310-515, and the other is just further E, below an unsightly rubbish dump, facing N at O312-514.

Flora &amp; fauna The island is a significant wild bird habitat and holds internationally important numbers of breeding Cormorant, Shag, Razorbill and Guillemot. 59,000 breeding pairs of Guillemot were counted in 1995/1999, which makes it the second most important colony in Ireland after Rathlin Island (c.96,000 pairs). It is the most important colony for Herring Gull and Shag in the country. The 675 pairs (1999 census) of Cormorant qualify this as the largest colony in Ireland. The new Gannet colony started only 2008 is thriving summer 2010 at Harp Ear, the most NE point of the island O320-517.  In winter, there are up to 1,000 Greylag, and several other species of geese.  The Sunfish on display in the Natural History Museum was found in a rockpool at LW on Lambay. In the 1980s a herd of Red Necked Wallabies were donated by Dublin zoo, and began breeding in 1995.  They thrive to this day.  The colony is now 40+ strong, and hangs out at or near the summit, fenced off from the cattle. The last surviving substantial elm tree forest in Ireland is on Lambay. SPA Barnacle Goose, Peregrine History <em>Porphyry</em> flint tools of such a high quality as were probably ornamental were manufactured here from about 5,000 BC to 500 BC. The Romans never got to the Irish mainland that we know of for certain, but they did get to Lambay, traded with it, and called it <em>Limnios</em>. In 795, the first ever raid by the Vikings on Ireland happened here. Lambay is a Viking word, the <em>ay</em> meaning <em>island</em>. After the Battle of the Boyne in 1691, a 15th Century castle was used as a concentration camp for the defeated Jacobite troops.  This was converted / extended into a fine mansion around 1900 under the guidance of the renowned Lutyens.  So well is the development designed and carried out, only a trained eye can tell the new from the old.  All gates were constructed from timber carved to resemble salvaged shipwreck detritus. The sea area to the N and NE were for centuries an important anchorage for shipping awaiting entering or leaving Dublin port.  A harbour was constructed in the 1820s designed by <em>Nimmo</em>, larger than an island surely needs, proof of its then importance in the scheme of things. Seabirds eggs have been harvested here on the grand scale in times of crisis, most recently during WW2 or <em>The Emergency</em> as that débacle was known locally at the time, even being exported to England.  Apparently the birds all feed on municipal dumps across on the mainland and the eggs do no taste fishy at all at all. Lambay boasts one of Ireland’s only two <em>Real Tennis</em> or <em>Royal Tennis</em> courts, built in 1922/23 during the Civil War.  The court is the size and shape of a large tennis court but surrounded by low buildings with inward sloping roofs, where the ball may be whacked and retrieved.  The rules do not easily suggest themselves.  The other court survives in the grounds of the National Concert Hall in Dublin City. Praeger In 1905/6 Robert Lloyd Praeger, Ireland’s greatest ever naturalist, led a team of 20 professional naturalists to examine this isolated 2.5<em>km</em><sup>2</sup> island, with the intensity of a forensic police “finger tip” search. It was in part a post Darwinian experiment, in testing an offshore island as a focus point for development in the nature of species caused by lengthy estrangement from the mass. They didn’t find any, but they did find 5 species new to science (3 worms, 1 mite and 1 bristletail), 17 species new to the British Isles, and 90 new to Ireland.  They reported 60+ hectares of heath at the summit, now sadly reduced to two plants widely separated.  One pyramid orchid is conserved inside a wire cage against lawnmowers. Shipwreck The White Star Line lost the largest merchantman ever built in Britain, its biggest, best, and most modern passenger ship, on its maiden voyage, in a major tragedy with huge loss of life, trying to set a new record for the shortest ever sea passage to the new world for the British and Irish emigrants aboard. Sounds familiar ? Sounds like the <em>Titanic</em>? Wrong. Long before the Titanic in 1912, it had all happened before. The ‘<em>Tayleur’</em> left Liverpool in January 1854. It was about the first ever ironclad clipper, huge at 1979 tons, with masts 45m high, and at least 650 passengers, maybe a lot more. There were five different classifications of passengers, yet there was no mention of vegetables or fruit on any of its menus. Scurvy was just about then becoming understood. Clippers were square-riggers, built for forward speed, not for manoeuvring. It had little in the way of sea trials. The ship was undermanned. The crew was inexperienced. No one on board had yet worked out how to use a compass aboard a metal craft. “Magnetic deviation” was less understood at the time than magnetic variation. In thick weather, land was sighted ahead. It was misidentified, at terrible cost. Too late, remedial action failed. The passengers, knowing disaster was at hand, crowded the decks and got in the way of the crew.  Worse, communication among the crew became impossible in the bedlam on deck.  The ship struck the E point of Lambay. In shallow water, the ship died slowly against the rocks. Escape from the ship at this critical point favoured the able bodied, requiring climbing across a mesh of ropes to the shore.  While 200 of the 300 adult men made it, only 3 of the 200 others on board, women and children, survived. Many of the mainly Lascar and Chinese crew saved themselves and disappeared.  Bodies littered the shore for weeks after. More than half of all aboard drowned. A lot of the figures are estimates. 100 are buried on Lambay. It is guessed that 345 survived and did eventually make Australia. Three Chinese among the survivors gave the tribunal of enquiry the best accounts of the disaster, in which the captain was praised for his crisis management in all the circumstances. <strong>Carrickdorrish</strong> Sheet 43           O330-515 Barely offlying the main island, Carrickdorrish is a small low lying rocky islet, 300m NW of the NE corner (“the Nose”) of Lambay Island. The islet is an important roost site for many of Lambay Island’s gulls, waders, cormorants and shags. Grey Seals are regularly found hauled out on the numerous rocks and reefs. The narrow channel that separates Carrickdorrish from Lambay is shallow through which tides run strongly as well as outside S to the Nose of Lambay O332-512. Landing is possible from many points but probably easiest onto a sloping rock ledge in a nook on the SW side. The island is ideally positioned for a way stop / lunch point for anyone circumnavigating Lambay. No water.</p>\n",

The island marks the NE corner of a small attractive bay called Sunk Island Bay. The bay’s cliff edges hold good numbers of breeding seabirds, and the island has 40-50 pairs of Guillemots and Razorbills and c.10 pairs of Shags. Landing at times of HW is onto a very convenient flat rock platform at SW corner. No water. No camping. Climb to small grass covered top overlooking narrow cut on its W side. This very narrow cut with steep walls on both sides separates the island from Lambay Island. The cut is just about navigable by kayak in good conditions at HW. The passage is atmospheric but is committing as there is no room for paddle strokes so good judgement is necessary. <strong>Dublin North – Camping</strong> For camping kayakers on passage, getting past Dublin is a challenge. On the N side, possibilities are few. Skerries town is perfectly possible and particularly along the beach S of the town, but it is a quite public promenade. The inner islands off Skerries offer an alternative choice, but all harbour rat populations for company, as does Ireland’s Eye further S. There are two possibilities that are well secluded, or at least unobtrusive. O198-660 – Balbriggan 2<em>km</em> NNW of the town. Known locally as Bell’s Field, Bremore this headland area has some good sandy beaches located along its northern side with grassy areas for camping. No water available. The area is of archaeological interest and several burial mounds are present. O272-584 – Shenick’s Point Midway Skerries / Loughshinny, camping is available on grassland above an E-facing storm beach. It is best approached at local HW as landings at the lower waters leave a difficult carry. The site is attractive and relatively quiet and secluded. No water available. O270-545 – Rush North Beach Camping and caravan park, tel. 01-8437131. A short carry from HW mark. Land onto a safe sandy beach. Pub grub at 400<em>m</em> walk.

        "description": "<p><strong>Malahide Arches</strong> O225-469          Sheet 50 The Dublin to Belfast railway line runs across the middle of the Malahide Estuary supported on a 12 arch bridge built on top of a man-made weir.  Malahide at 180<em>m</em> is the longest tidal railway viaduct in Ireland.  Built in 1844 in timber, that didn’t work.  Re-built in 1860 in stone with a wrought iron superstructure, it needed to be strengthened in 1932, for diesel locomotives.  The stone sub-works were always under pressure and despite re-pointing, the lot was replaced with pre-stressed concrete in 1966-1968.  Then in 1998 the timber sleepers in use all over Ireland for 150 years on railway lines were replaced with concrete, to allow continuous welding (impacting on garden design countrywide). The Malahide Sea Scouts knew for generations that good conditions existed for surfing on an incoming tide of HW 4.0<em>m</em> upwards, and sometimes even at lower levels. This information hit the general canoeing community in the early 1990s and the spot became very popular.  It was these local scouts that spotted an impending disaster in August 2009.  They reported severe scouring, but no-one listened, at least not attentively enough. A single pier collapsed, slightly on the S side of the middle, so that two spans then collapsed.  This was minutes after the passing of the inter-city express.  Minutes later, thankfully in daylight, the next train driver saw what needed to be seen, and no lives were lost. It happened at a big 4.5<em>m</em>(local average 4.1<em>m</em>) spring tide, just before LW. The tide floods inwards over most of the weir for a couple of hours coming up to HW, and outwards for the rest.  Because most of the face of the weir is studded with anti-scouring boulders, the weir is often mostly impassable, even to kayaks. However, when the weir was being re-built in 2010, the railway company incorporated a very special feature. The canoeing community credits the Malahide scouts with Ireland’s only purpose built leisure facility exploiting tidal energy, designed by humans for humans to play in.   Under the 5<sup>th</sup> arch from the N, a slide 4<em>m</em> wide, 0.3<em>m</em> deep and 28<em>m</em> long has been constructed on the E sea-facing side, its head at the lip of the weir and its foot at LW.  This is known as “Macker’s Slide”, after Paul McEvoy, the scout master who made it possible.  Scout leader Ivan Barrett was the first to shoot the slide, and the McKernan sisters the first females. Playtime Before 2009 the play conditions had existed on the W landward face of the weir, allowing play for about 3 hours of the 12, on immaculate standing waves and stoppers.  The post 2010 arrangement does not allow that, but instead the incoming tide creates the neatest flows and eddies imaginable, on fast flat water, the finest teaching environment possible, particularly ideal for progressing intermediates. The slide has walls either side 0.3<em>m</em> deep.  This allows preferential flow at the slide, incoming as well as outgoing, permitting such conditions on quite small tides at this particular arch. Post 2010 also allows playtime at the foot of the slide on the E seaward face, for maybe 10 hours of the cycle, pretty much the whole time except when the weir is covered, say from +0030 HW Dublin until -0130, varying a bit between neaps and springs.  The slide works above a tide height of about 3.8<em>m</em>.  The higher it gets the more powerful the hydraulics, but it never “grips” unsafely,nor does it ever “wash out”, there being something in it always for someone. The wave is certainly more powerful on larger tides, is progressively more retentive as the water level outside drops, and at all times the side walls need care exiting the stopper wave.  LW on regular tides is a very suitable time for teaching beginners because an instructor can stand on the flat foundations just beyond the wave and extract a learner caught in the wave.  Throw ropes are very useful for all parties at all times on the wave. Launch The put in point O227-463 is about 1<em>km</em> SE at a slipway just SE of the Marina Village.  Follow the one-way road system around clockwise from the village centre and park where you can.  The slip is on the left just before the road heads right and inland again.  Keep the marina on your left paddling out. The railway is not at first in sight. SPA Bar-tailed Godwit, Golden Plover, Little Egret, Ruff, Kingfisher.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Ireland’s Eye</strong> O284-414          Sheet 50 Ireland’s Eye is an interesting, small, uninhabited island off Howth Harbour. Circumnavigation is recommended as the cliff scenery is excellent. The island is most attractive and most popular in early summer. There is a regular ferry in season, from Howth East Pier. The island is noted for its rock climbing on the tor at the NE corner, on the sea stack just off it, and also on the big cliff centred on the N side. Do please though exercise caution as regards bird life, and climb later in the season. The church dates back to 700 AD, and is called Cill MacNessan. A manuscript similar to the more famous Book of Kells was penned here by three monks, and it is also preserved in Trinity College Dublin. SPA Peregrine. The island is a breeding ground for various auks, Fulmar, Kittiwake, Shag, Cormorant, gulls, and others. In particular, a Gannet colony started to breed here in 1989, and is now the only significant such colony between the Saltees to the S and Ailsa Craig in Scotland. Embarkation and Landing There is convenient access at a public slipway beside the Lifeboat Station at O285-394 in Howth Harbour. Landings can be had at various points, the best of which is at the sandy beach just SE of the Martello Tower. No water. The lusher parts of the island are rat infested, making camping unattractive. <strong>The Round of Howth Head</strong> The round of Howth Head is a popular trip for Dublin sea paddlers. Ireland’s Eye is also attractive to take in as part of the excursion. Attractive for its scenery, and its handy shuttle, the only downside to this trip used always be a sewerage outlet operating just off the Nose of Howth at O301389 on the NE corner of the Head. However, the situation is much improved in 2010 as most of the sewage now goes to the modern treatment works in Sutton and Ringsend. The put-in point to the N is at the public slipway at the RNLI station in Howth Harbour. There is plentiful parking. To the S of the Head, the launching point is the sandy beach at Sutton Sailing Club at O265-377, just NW of the Martello Tower. The Club is welcoming to small competent and considerate parties. Parking is limited so it is not suitable for large groups. Also, at LW, the tide goes a long way out. A shingle beach at O296-373, 1<em>km</em> N of the Bailey Lighthouse O297-363 offers a welcome break, and there is even a track upwards to the commonage above. Stopping is also possible in several places on the S-facing side of the head. The round of Howth is usually done anti-clockwise, on a rising tide, best in calm or gentle southerlies. An ‘out and back’ trip from Howth Harbour is also quite feasible and avoids the shuttle. SPA Fulmar, Cormorant, Shag, Herring Gull, Kittiwake, Guillemot, Razorbill, Black Guillemot. Tides The main east coast streams run north and south off the Bailey and the Nose and on both sides of Ireland’s Eye, where 2kn can be achieved. There can be very bumpy water anywhere on the seaward side, especially with wind over tide. It can be quite nasty in particular at the Bailey where the tidal stream coming out of Dublin Bay meets the main stream.

Off Arklow it is called – the Arklow Bank, off  Greystones – the Codling Bank, off Bray – the Bray Bank, off Dublin South – the Kish Bank, and then off Dublin North – the Bennet Bank.  Tides flow differently inside and outside this offshore feature. From the Dublin perspective, inside the Kish Bank off Dublin South lies the smaller Burford Bank, a shallow area across almost the whole of the entrance to the bay.  Then, further E and dominating the outside of the bay, a major lighthouse lies at the N end of the outer Kish Bank (known locally and simply as “the Kish”), and prominent lights flash at the N and S ends of the Burford Bank. Outside the Kish the waters are deep, say 25<em>m</em>, at the Kish they are, say 15m, then inside the Kish they are relatively shallow, say 25<em>m</em>.  Waters are then deep to the W (with the exception of the Burford Bank outside the bay itself, which goes down to 5<em>m</em>.), to a line between Howth Head and Dalkey, when the bay gets shallow and stays shallow.</p>\n",

In foggy weather a gong was sounded but when the Holyhead Packet ship was expected an 18 pounder gun was fired. In 1954 the first of the all electric light vessels – Gannet – was placed on the station. In November 1965 the Kish Light-vessel was withdrawn and replaced by the Kish lighthouse.   Round Trip for a kayak – 3.5 to 4 hours Inner part The inner part of the bay, with its city and industrial surrounds, holds little interest for sea kayakers, and is dealt with briefly. All the practical embarkation points are considered. The outer parts of the inner part of the bay, from Dun Laoghaire to Dalkey Island on the S side, and from Sutton to Howth on the N side, are justifiably popular. popular. Tidal Overview The tide floods north and ebbs south off the entrance to the bay. Inside the bay, the situation is more complex. Tides in the middle of the bay are almost stationary. The streams circulate around the edges. The effect of this is to constantly renew the waters of the bay which dissipates the worst polluting effects of the nearby population. Timings and strengths are very different on the two sides of the bay. The flood enters the Bay through Muglins and Dalkey Sounds, past Dun Laoghaire Harbour, around the bay and out past the Bailey. The ebb flows past the Bailey towards Dun Laoghaire Harbour and out southeast along the shore to Dalkey Island and it also eddies around the northern part of the bay. Tides in the north In the northern part of Dublin Bay, the tides are as per the southern side of Howth Head. Tides in Dublin Harbour The streams inside the harbour, under ordinary conditions, go with the rising and falling tide. Beware however heavy rainfall causing the river to flood. The overlying fresh water conditions favour short weak floods and long strong ebbs and the outgoing stream can thus be very strong at the mouth, reaching 3.5kn. This is typical of heavily freshwater-fed enclosed places. Tides in the south See Dalkey Island below. Coastline North Bull Island forms the entire inner, N side of the Bay, involving a substantial LW carry. Landing, but without road access, is occasionally possible along the S shore of Howth Head. Landing is possible all the way from the mouth of the Liffey to Sandycove, except for regulated areas inside the busy ferry port of Dun Laoghaire Harbour where some parts must be totally avoided. In particular, keep well away from the SE of the harbour. The closer to Dublin though, the less conducive it becomes to land. From Dun Laoghaire Harbour inwards, the shore is mostly sandy beach, with the tide receding long distances at LW. In addition, the railway runs all the way along here making road access only occasionally available. From Sandycove at O257-281 to Sorrento Point at the S end of Dalkey Sound at O273-261, the ground is almost entirely small granite cliffs fronting impressive private property. Pretty, but landing is practical only at the three public harbours, Sandycove, Bullock and Coliemore. <strong>Dublin Bay Embarkation Points</strong></p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Bull Island</strong> O227-374          Sheet 50 N of Dublin Port is the North Bull Island, in the NW corner of the bay. It is connected to the shore by an ancient wooden bridge at O213-359 at its SW end, and a road/causeway at O225-374, midway along the island, built 1962. Much silting of the inner stretch of water has occurred since then, especially close to the causeway, which is now recognised to have been an environmental nightmare, and studies are underway to find a solution. The North Bull Wall which bounds the island on the S also delimits the N side of Dublin Port, and was built in 1825 on the advice of the famous cartographer and harbour builder, Captain Bligh, of <em>Bounty</em> fame. SPA Golden Plover, Bar-tailed Godwit, Great Northern Diver, Little Egret, Peregrine, Merlin, Short-eared Owl. The significance of the Bull for bird watchers is in the huge numbers and the variety of species. It is popular because the birds may be easily watched. Living close to buses, cars, golfers, joggers and even dogs, the birds do not startle easily. In the channels, the rising tide concentrates the birds as it pushes them up the shore, and they can be watched from very close range. The Bull features prominently in the early stages of the education of all Dublin birders. It holds its interest for even the very advanced, because it is always throwing up surprises – rare migrants, and the odd mega-vagrant. The Bull has internationally important numbers of Brent Goose,<em>kn</em>, and many other winter species. Most of the centre of the island is taken up with two golf courses, which are fenced off from the outer rim. Birders are found mostly on the mainland side, and swimmers favour the open beach on the outer side. Hares abound on the golf courses and are tolerated with equanimity by the golfers. There is an Interpretive Centre near the causeway. It probably owes its existence to its timing, as it was built shortly before planning permission became necessary.  </p>\n",

No reliable water has been found but a well W of the church, just above the shore, is kept whitewashed. The views of Dublin Bay from both the Martello Tower and the ruined fort are well worth the trouble. Until a generation ago, the King of Dalkey Island was elected locally and crowned on the island, but the practice died out in the 1980s. History Roman coinage was found here dated to 352AD, so the Romans may have traded from a base here.  Vikings named it <em>Dalk Eyja</em> (“Thorn Island”) and the Irish name means the same “<em>Deilg Inis</em>“. Archaeological excavations have revealed Mesolithic Bann flakes, Neolithic hollow scrapers and Bronze Age arrowheads on the island. In the early medieval period, the island was a base for sea-going traders, importing goods from the Mediterranean and western France. The medieval church is dedicated to St.Begnet. The lintelled doorway is a feature of the period prior to the 12<sup>th</sup> Century. The bellcote high on the gable above is likely to have been added later, possibly in the 15th Century. The high side walls might also have been raised about then. The fireplace at the E end was added when the church was used as a residence by soldiers and masons in the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. The Martello Tower and the gun battery were built in response to the threat of invasion from French forces around 1804 and 1805. The tower is exceptionally large. The original entrance is high up and was reached by a ladder. The present entrance (recently closed, unfortunately) is an insertion and leads directly into the magazine. The gun platform on the roof mounted two 24-pounder guns. The gun battery is built into the granite cliffs on the southern tip of the island. While it is unimposing from the mainland, ships sailing into Dublin Bay would have had three large guns trained on them. Embarkation Embark from Bullock Harbour at O263-277, 3<em>km</em> NW, rather than the nearer Coliemore Harbour. Launching and parking is easier. Landing Landing is best at a little beach on the landward side of the NW corner, W of the church. There is also a little cove just inside the nearby pier. The beach here is usable except on the bottom third of the tide. A regular ferry runs from Coliemore Harbour opposite to the pier.

The higher, 240<em>m</em> peak is to the S. At shore level, there are two roughly equivalent headlands, Bray Head at O286-170 and Cable Rock at O290-156. Cable Rock is a pronounced headland with an off-lying rock. There are large seabird colonies on the head in the breeding season. Swell develops if there are sustained or strong winds from N, E or S, and gives difficult conditions all along the headland from the promenade in Bray to Cable Rock. The sea frequently breaks over Cable Rock, 80<em>m</em> off the headland. The tide flows strongly through the gap. Beware of a deeper rock, about 50m off the shore, which breaks the lower half of the tide in bad conditions. The sea state off Bray Head is almost always more severe than on the adjoining coast. Rogue waves are not unusual. This is not a place to go swimming, as the escape routes are tricky, the few storm beaches having dumping surf. This whole 3<em>km</em> section is a fine paddle, very scenic, the slopes of Bray Head rising above, and the cliffs at the water’s edge a modest rock-climbing haven. Look for the climbing cliffs just N of the Cable Rock headland. They are identified by the metal spikes in the steep ground in the first 20m above HW where the railway tunnel opens. There are three landable storm beaches on the head, but they are exposed and steep, or even missing, at HW. Above them runs the railway line, which was engineered out of the cliff with great difficulty in the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century.

The backdrop however is the Wicklow Hills, known as the Garden of Ireland, always lovely. Landing can be achieved at any point but the shingle beach is mostly steep with dumping surf. On land, the going is anything but boring. The railway runs the entire length of the stretch, right on top of the beach, with pleasant perambulating pathways beside it. Four roads come down to the sea from the coastal highway, so the section may be broken into smaller bits for more leisurely-minded strollers. The more determined can walk from Bray or Greystones to Wicklow and get the train back. SPA Bewick and Whooper Swan, Little Tern, Golden Plover, Bar-tailed Godwit. 1<em>km</em> of rocky coastline S from the harbour, the town ends and the long beach begins at O299-121. The hinterland along the entire stretch attracts rare bird species, especially waders, and particularly in winter. 6<em>km</em> S along the sandy beach, the Kilcoole wetland system flows under a bridge at O315-061, called locally “The Breaches”, and into the sea. This wetland system is unique in being so low-lying that it has been scantily mapped by the OS. More to the naturalist’s taste, there are two eco-systems in one, fresh water and salt water, side by side. The two are wonderfully different, barely separated, and the subject of much study as to their comparable flora and fauna. Barry O’Flynn of nearby Kilcoole carried out the first study in 1973.  The more northerly is fresh water and includes a Birdwatch Ireland reserve, 1.5<em>km</em> N of the Breaches. In summer, there is a colony of Little Tern maybe 200<em>m</em> N of the Breaches, the largest in Ireland, also a Birdwatch Ireland reserve, between the bridge and a major stand of Sea Buckthorn.  The terns nest in the gravel of the beach, and are so splendidly camouflaged that it is truly inconsiderate to walk on the beach hereabouts at all in season. The colony area is well marked from landward. Please therefore be careful if landing. Birdwatch Ireland are rumoured to have had a major crisis of conscience some years back about this colony.  It was preyed upon by a Kestrel, who could scope the area wonderfully from a perch on the electricity wires where they crossed the bridge.  The kestrel was so successful that it became necessary to employ wardens on a permanent 24/7 rota. Even the permanent wardening wasn’t enough and there were rumblings of a strategic alliance with a local gun club. The kestrel became famous under the stage name “Kevin the Killer Kestrel from Kilcoole”. It is said the Irish Minister for the Environment somehow persuaded his governmental colleague the Minister for Energy to put all electricity wires in the area underground, even at the bridge, and apparently it worked.  Kevin lost his easy number, got bored, and went away, as bored kestrels do. About 3<em>km</em> further S is Six Mile Point at O318-038, the most easterly point on the route.

Embarkation Wicklow Harbour is by far the easiest access hereabouts for day trips to Wicklow Head, or journeys N.  Use a sheltered gravel beach just inside the W pier where there is plenty of parking, reached by crossing the bridge in the town. Alternatively, use a slipway beside the Lifeboat Station just inside the East Pier T322-941, where parking is more restricted, reached by turning hard right before the bridge. Broad Lough The Leitrim River, only 1<em>km</em> long, connects the Broad Lough to Wicklow Harbour. The Broad Lough is an expanse of fresh water, running N for 4 to 5<em>km</em>, just inside the shoreline. The Lough is bounded on its E by a thin spit of low-lying land down which runs the main Dublin to Rosslare railway line. On the W is Tinakilly House, and some of the finest reed beds a thatcher ever saw. This is a summer breeding place of Reed Warbler. It is a wild place, home to Greylag Geese and myriad other wintering species in the cold months. It can be shallow and muddy at anything except HW, which is sometime later than at Wicklow town itself. The Leitrim River is tidal with a significant flow on the narrower stretches when the water level in the harbour is lower than that in the lough. Broad Lough is good to paddle when conditions are bad elsewhere. SPA Little Egret, Hen Harrier, Peregrine, Merlin, Ruff, Bar-tailed Godwit, Kingfisher.</p>\n",

On the head is a huge lighthouse, amongst the most powerful on the E coast. There are cliffs and caves on both sides. There is a pronounced eddy system either side of the head itself, and guaranteed playtime except for the shortest of slacks. On passage, err with caution to get past efficiently, as this is undoubtedly one of the most significant headlands of the S part of the E coast.

Local paddlers say 6kn. On the flood, the tide race is 600m to the south of the lighthouse. On the ebb, there is a small race at Bride’s Head between Wicklow Harbour and Wicklow Head. The main race is under the lighthouse. It is always possible to rest in eddies except when the wind is from the eastern quadrant. From Wicklow Harbour to Wicklow Head, the tide close inshore always runs southeast. On the ebb, it runs strongly at up to 3kn. On the flood, a major eddy system operates. Local paddlers report considerable struggles close inshore in springs. Going north, keep in the bumpy main flow for 1km at least and then keep at least 1km offshore until Wicklow Harbour. Going south, on the other side of Wicklow Head, keep in the main flow as long as you can. A weaker eddy system operates, almost as far as Long Rock at Silver Strand at T338-910. Inshore tides all along the Wicklow and Wexford coasts generally follow the direction of the coast and information on timing is unreliable. From Wicklow Head to Arklow, the flood is thought to run up to 3kn in springs and the ebb at 1kn and the best estimate for times is the same as Wicklow Head. Embarkation Access to the Head is usually from Wicklow town as described above, but if a launching from S is preferred, there are several awkward choices. Public access is always available from Brittas Bay, but this is 10<em>km</em> to the S. Closer access points involve an awkward carry down steep steps to a beach. Magheramore beach at T330-884 is loved by surfers, especially on a low tide with a sustained wind from the S/SSE. Surfers leave their cars out on the road at T324-886 and carry their equipment to the beach, on foot. The access at Silver Strand at T337-911 is the most reliable, at least in summer, and closest. The road access at T336-914 is through the more N of two paying caravan parks above the beach. It involves a cruelly steep carry down long steps and a (seemingly) much longer carry back up later. Camping is possible and the surroundings are pleasant. This is a famous fishing spot, and there is friendly surf on the beach for playing in. It may be closed in wintertime. SPA Peregrine, Merlin.

Things do change by the minute, but more slowly, more profoundly too.  The larger picture is that huge changes occurred throughout the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Rosslare Point lies nowadays 4.5<em>km</em> SSW of Raven Point but was always historically about 1<em>km</em> to its SE ! Storms broke through the narrow Rosslare penninsula in the winter of 1924/1925, making an island out of the tip, leaving its mediaeval fort and 47 coastguard houses stranded, which have since almost disappeared, as the island sank into the sand.  Tern Island, inside the newly widened mouth, was sold by a local to Birdwatch Ireland in the early 1970s but disappeared in a storm shortly after.  What is now Horseshoe Island (SE of the entrance) was once part of the burrow of Rosslare, reachable by Honda 50 until the late 1970s. Because of the shallows, beware almost constant rough water the width of the harbour entrance and for a ways outside.  The safest passage inwards or outwards these days seems to be hard by The Raven Point or N side, but it is poorly marked.  Rough water occurs on rising and falling tides. On passage past, best perhaps keep somewhat off the direct line.</p>\n",

The NE part of the island, having marram grass, may be “growing” again?  Secondly, to say it is redolent of history is an extraordinary understatement.  The “fort” on the SW part T114-213 is on the “other” SW half of the “island”. The island is huge.  It probably covers 100 hectares at LWS.  It runs SW/NE.  The fort is near the SW tip.  The summit is far to the NE.  Across the channel dividing the two parts.  The actual NE tip is somewhere way further north again, out of sight of the summit, appearing to stretch away and away maybe almost towards Curracloe.  The main channel once entered on the north side of the island between the island and Ravens Point, but no more.  The main channel now enters south of the island, the channel now halfway between Ravens Point and Rosslare Point. Tides Tides run strong.  Trawlers can be seen on the ebb, with their engines growling, barely making progress up the main channel south of the island.  The tides pour out of the harbour 9 / 12, supposedly weakly, and inwards 3 / 12, supposedly strongly.  HW at the quayside in Wexford town is Dublin -0430.  The tidal streams inside the harbour turn with HW and LW at the Wexford quayside.  Further out, HW/LW at our island / the harbour mouth, is about 75 miutes earlier.

Much of the return journey is in 20cm of water, and hard on the system.</li>\n<li>Do not make the mistake of trying to get closer, up by the bird reserve, 1km east.Anyone getting up on the tidal restraining wall will cause 10,000 geese to put to wing, and a tribunal of enquiry will follow locally, immediately, with lynching a strong possible outcome.  Birders are highly motivated folk and are not to be underestimated.</li>\n<li>Other possibilities apparent on the OS, further east, are dead ends.Unless perhaps one works for Coillte.</li>\n<li>Curracloe to the north T115-266 in W wind might be on.</li>\n<li>Confident paddlers might consider Rosslare Point T110-187, but be sure to have made your will before departing.See what Jasper Wynne has to say about the matter.  I have seen the tides thereabouts with wind over and would not wish them on ordinary folks.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The fort for which the island is named was built in 1642 as part of the great struggle then overwhelming Ireland as part of the greater UK conflict.  “Royalists” stuck by their king, while “Parliamentarians” wanted democracy.  The Irish ”Confederates” just wanted to be left out of it.  Problem was that after Irish Ireland was so badly beaten at Kinsale in 1601, a lot of UK commercial interests followed.  These then expanded in Ireland, as such things have always developed, mostly agricultural on this particular occasion, at the time termed “planting”.  The 1600s was a cruel century and the 1640s a cruellest of decades (it had competition, later).  In 1641 all hell broke loose when the Confederates saw their opportunity, and in due course, one Oliver Cromwell was despatched by the Parliamentarians in the UK to subdue and punish the Irish pretenders.  He was a man in a hurry.  Custom of the time gave mercy to towns surrendering without the attackers having to waste bullets and even lives in an attack, and surrender was well rewarded, as it were. Dublin did, Drogheda didn’t, and were treated accordingly.  The Wexford defenders agreed to surrender, then broke the deal, tried to renegotiate. This really irritated the great man and Wexford paid the price. The defence of Wexford included our Rosslare Fort.  Cromwell’s navy arrived off Wexford Harbour and the small garrison fought heroically until their supply of ammunition was exhausted.They did escape, except perhaps they didn’t understand all the rules and they left their wives and children behind, 89 of them. Cromwell rounded-up the wives and children left behind and forced them to trudge along to just outside the walls of Wexford. Despite their pleas and their heart-rending shrieks they were all massacred without mercy.  One by one.  Wexford eventually got the message and surrendered. Locals say the remains of the fort and houses appear and disappear at times, but in late 2011 there was only a remnant breakwater to remind anyone where the fort once stood, nowadays marked by a N mark on a pole (in 2011 it should have been an east mark, in 2015 it should have been a south mark).</p>\n",

The island has been formed since the early 1980s when neighbouring Tern Island was washed away in winter storms.  The neighbour, Tern Island, was known to hold some 2000+ breeding Irish Roseate Terns. The species’ last refuge was Rockabill, Co. Dublin, where a dedicated wardening and conservation scheme began in 1989, which has been successful in restoring the breeding numbers.

The passage is 11<em>km</em> from the beach, and deserves respect. There is a very remote and exposed feel to this place, which is famous for its lighthouse. Landing The steps at the small quay on the ENE side are probably the best landing. There is a narrow channel behind the quay but it surges. There are steps on the WNW side, should sea conditions allow. There are possible exposed landings at the S, and some shelving slabs on the N side, either of which might work. Fauna The island has an impressive list of recorded bird species, largely documented by R. <em>M</em>. Barrington (1900). Successive light keepers assembled the records from detailed recording in the 1800s. The island is a magnet for migrant birds due to its strategic position as the main entry and exit point from Ireland to mainland Europe. Barrington records several occasions when over 3,000 birds were killed at the light in one night during poor weather conditions. Seal, Common Porpoise and Dolphin are frequently reported. Tides and Trip Planning The trip planning requires thought. The tides run at over 3kn in the main channel on springs. A straight out-and-back ferry glide is impractical for slow boats – a slingshot approach is recommended from the northwest.  There is no suitable launching place to the southwest and worse, the tide sets over a dangerous shallow area halfway out called The Bailies at T177-060. This long, thin, north/south strip should be avoided. The option of coming from the north avoids The Bailies and means catching the last of the south-going ebb.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Between Tuskar and the mainland</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">N</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:30 after Dublin HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">S</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:30 before Dublin HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Aim to be on the rock at slack water. Launch 90 minutes beforehand at 3 hours after Dublin HW from the beach at T140-123 at the back (i.e. southeast) of Rosslare Harbour pier. The entrance is just off the roundabout at the entrance to the ferry terminal. Here there is room for large groups with a manageable carry to the water, but beware of a 2m height barrier. The harbour is the major ferry terminal of the southeast of Ireland. Make no mistake – on the way out, get well out from the land and come down onto the rock. The return journey is simpler but more energetic.  Make for the mainland and then creep round Greenore Point. Be careful not to be swept past the harbour and into the shipping lane. Contrary ENE flood streams speed up and overfalls occur at The Bailies and off Greenore Point.  Paddle hard. An alternative embarkation point or emergency landing spot is St. Helens Pier at T146-099.  Sheltered from east/south except in heavy swell, when it may close out, a slipway inside a pier gives much less fussy and plentiful parking, no height barriers, rough camping and even a picnic table with a street light.  The tides need closer watching though.  On the way out creep up to Greenore to provide a more manageable ferry angle and on the return be that touch more motivated. Dangers (a) Local paddlers report that the tide running past Greenore Point (as the tired paddler returns to land from the sea) can be the strongest encountered in the area. There is a report of a party seeing a lobster pot in this area, in mist, 1 or 2<em>km</em> out. Having decided to check the direction and speed of the current, they could not make it upstream to the pot! Consider that any slippage here shovels the paddler into the busiest part of the main shipping channel, and the need for care cannot be exaggerated.

It was also a dangerous place to be during World War 2, a light-keeper lost his life and a second was injured when a drifting mine exploded against the rock. <strong>The South Coast</strong> <strong>Carnsore Point to Baltimore</strong> <strong>The Saltees</strong> Sheet 77 Embarkation Mainland launching is from the convenient, sheltered, pebbly beach immediately behind the W pier at Kilmore Quay. The beach is tucked in between the pier and Crossfarnoge (or Forlorn) Point at S965-032. Free parking is plentiful, but there is a height barrier at the more convenient end, and the carry is across boulders.  Toilets and water. Parking is more limited at or near the harbour itself. Launching is possible off the slipway, but there is a per boat charge, rigorously policed. The beach on the E side of the harbour extends out a long way, so is inadvisable at LW.  At HW the parking is free and the carry is easy.  This beach is also sheltered in W winds. Dangers The main local trouble spot is an underwater bridge, very shallow, called Saint Patrick’s Bridge. It starts 500m E of Kilmore Quay pier, and reaches out, in a crescent shape, all the way to Little Saltee. It is particularly troublesome on the E going tide. Boats not travelling fast enough, or not laying off enough, will be pulled down onto the bridge, where rough and accelerated water is hard to escape. This happens almost immediately after leaving the harbour. If caught, it is best to ferry glide in behind Little Saltee. 3.5<em>kn</em> is achieved in springs. Saltee Sound, between the two islands, is another trouble spot. Sebber Bridge at X956-978 is a shallow reef, which extends northwards from the NE tip of Great Saltee. The tide sets more or less E/W through the Sound, over the shallows. On the W making tide, especially with a wind from the W, the water becomes very rough indeed N of Great Saltee. SPA Peregrine, Chough. Tides Trip planning requires care for the strong tidal streams, the timings of which do tend to catch out the unwary. Local kayakers strongly disagree with officially published timings, saying they are up to 2 hours out. It may well be that timings vary considerably with wind conditions, and whether there are springs or neaps occurring. One thing all local kayakers agree on is that on leaving the harbour area, you always look at a lobster pot buoy to check your calculations are right. Local HW is 20 minutes after Cobh.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Saltees – St. Patrick’s Bridge</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:50 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">3:30 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The official published information is that the E making flood tide in the two sounds flows for 6 hours, beginning at about Cobh HW –0035 and ebbs W in reverse for 6 hours from Cobh +0535. This is the same as saying the E flood about an hour before local HW and the W ebb begins about an hour before local LW. Local paddlers insist this cycle begins an hour or even two hours ahead of that. If so, the E making flood tide begins at Cobh HW -0230 or so and the W ebb begins at Cobh +0330. They say that slacks occur when the tide is halfway up or down the harbour wall. If it is halfway up and rising, the E making flood is about to start. If it is half way down and falling, the W making ebb is underway. Be cautious of making the crossing on the strongest of the E making tide (local HW or thereabouts), especially if there are any slow-boats in the party, for fear of Saint Patrick’s Bridge. Avoid also the strongest of the W making tide (local LW or thereabouts) to avoid the run off over Sebber Bridge. If needs must, cross either  race as high as possible, as the water really kicks up downstream of the gaps.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Little Saltee Island</strong> X966-996          Sheet 77 This island is less frequented than its better-known and more interesting neighbour. Historically, 3 people or so lived on Little Saltee until the mid-19th Century, when rumour insists it was connected to the mainland. Little Saltee was farmed until World War 2. The farm speciality was early-season new potatoes, but corn and other vegetables were also grown. 12 people were needed at harvest time. A thresher was brought over, in parts, in small boats. The island was abandoned and overgrown until recently. Since 1999, the owners now farm pedigree Kerry cows, fallow deer,  and since 2003 Soay sheep, from the Scottish island of same name, just S of Skye, well known to climbers. The main house and some of its outbuildings have been made habitable. The courtyard has been tidied. There is a fine ruin of a two-storey barn and interesting remains of corn stands in the yard immediately W of the main building. There are the remains of an old well within the courtyard but it did not hold water in April 2003 and appeared long disused. Landing A flagpole above the main landing on the NW side at X966-996 presumably indicates when the family is in residence. Landing is possible among boulders below the house, normally reasonably sheltered by offshore boulders and rocks. One may also land elsewhere less dependably. Try the SW side on any of three storm beaches facing the Great Saltee. These are very much easier on lower tide levels. Camping The most suitable level ground for camping is in the area just W of the main house. Bracken and bluebells dominate the island and there are few grassy areas along the flatter western side. The vegetation is broken, lumpy and heavily grazed. The most pleasant areas are on the southern edge overlooking the storm beaches and the sound to Great Saltee. Do ask permission if the owners are in residence.</p>\n",

Grazed and easily walked or camped on, this island is lovely and deservedly popular with Irish paddlers. The island is a famed bird-watching spot, and is often inhabited by birding visitors in season, mainly spring and autumn. Once inhabited by 20 people, the island became uninhabited relatively early by Irish island standards. There are monuments and references to Prince Michael of Saltee on the island. He bought the island in 1943, crowned himself Prince in 1972, and died in 1998. Renewed interest in the island by his extended family has resulted in some of the scrub being removed around the remains of the old rick yard and the corn stands are more clearly visible. Landing Land at X952-974 on the N side, E of the middle. The main landing area has recently been improved with a channel having been cleared through the boulder beach, which in June 2003 gave a welcome sandy strip even at the lower stages of the tide. There are steps above to a house in trees. This landing is sheltered in most conditions. Privacy Predictably, members of the family are almost certainly in residence in August, long weekends, or periods of settled good weather. The tradition of flying the Prince of Saltee flag from the flagpole above the landing when the family are in residence has been renewed. During such periods, day-trippers must arrive later than 1100 and vacate the island by 1630.  Camping is not permitted. Circumnavigation Circumnavigation gives good fun in tidal races off the appropriate points, but beware that there is much eddying. There is excellent cliff scenery, and a particularly pretty channel just E of the S tip. Sea conditions at the southern tip become fearsome in strong winds or with wind against tide.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Hook Penninsula</strong> X733-973          Sheet 76 Hook Head is a popular kayaking and scuba diving area based on the main town Fethard.  A very attractive area, there is almost always sheltered sea-going hereabouts, almost regardless of wind direction.  Beloved of divers, there is always calm water somewhere for the training of beginners. Out at the Head there are arches and blowholes, caves and wrecks, and clear shallow water mostly.  The extensive sand beaches at Duncannon and Fethard contrast with the rocky cliffs by the Head itself.  Across Waterford Harbour lies the beautiful fishing and tourist village of Dunmore East, to which excursions may be made, landing at the pier, which was the first ever built by Nimmo. Early History The early history of the Hook mirrors the early history of Ireland generally.  The rocks locally are all sedimentary, limestones from 510,000,000 BP at the tip, then sandstones mudstones and siltstones progressively northwards.  Below Wood Village one can see the four post-ice age strata, a wave cut platform of former shoreline cut in folded siltstones, fossil raised beach, overlying mass of earth called “head”, and on top material called “till”, debris deposited by melting ice sheets 10,000 BP.  Ptolemy’s map of Ireland 100+AD recognised the Barrow River (called “<em>Birgos</em>”) and appears to recognise Baginbun Head as a promontory fort known to the locals as <em>Dún Domhnaill</em>.  There were 45 ring forts once, built 600 – 900 AD, with 13 surviving.  These are now accepted as “one off” farmsteads and not specifically military.  Almost all placenames are Viking.  Bannow Island is where the Normans landed in 1169, invited in by Dermot McMurrough, the ultimate traitor.  In quick time they captured Wexford town.  In 1170 Richard leGros with +100 men landed at Baginbun Head, on its sheltered beach, with its defendable promontory, which he then defended successfully in battle against the men of Waterford.  Shortly after, Richard deClare (Strongbow) landed at Passage East and together they beat the depleted Waterford defences and took the town.  All this is considered good news by modern interpretation, but then the English followed in 1172 (not so good).  The lighthouse on the Head itself was the first ever in Ireland, possibly in these islands, and it is the only Irish secular mediaeval building still serving its original function.  Guided tours are available all summer.  In 1,400+ Slade Castle was constructed. Modern History The story of Duncannon Fort reflects more recent Irish history.  When Irish Ireland was soundly defeated at Kinsale in 1603, the island of Ireland was severely under-populated at about 750,000.  The “settlement” of Ireland then began, and the island became subject to immigration fromEngland and Scotland.  Protestant / Catholic tensions across Europe were thus imported onto the island of Ireland.  In 1641 there was civil war in England between Parliament and King, and revolution and slaughter was everywhere, including in Ireland, including the Hook.  Scots and Northern Irish Protestants (“Royalists”) backed the king, while the indigenous Irish, as well as those Normans and <em>ye olde Englishe</em> who had gone native over the centuries they had been here (“Confederates”) saw the chance for independence.  Duncannon Fort played a huge role locally, and its Royalists were besieged time and again.  In 1644 it even changed sides – in English terms – to Parliamentarian, but this meant nothing from the local perspective.  In 1645 it was forced to surrender to the Confederates.  But then Cromwell arrived in Ireland in 1649 and put manners on them all.  The “Plantation of Ireland”, as Irish history terms the settlement of its land by these outsiders, then began in earnest.  The Planters were received with the affection and enthusiasm with which aboriginals worldwide traditionally always have and always will greet similar expansionary ambitions. After the battle of the Boyne in1691, both combatant kings departed Ireland from Duncannon.  James skulked, but William went in style.  The Hook wasn’t centrally involved in 1798, but nevertheless the worst anti-Protestant atrocity of the entire affair was perpetrated at Scullabulogue near Tintern Abbey when 100 elderly prisoners were burned in a barn.  Fethard Dock was the scene of the only naval action of that rebellion, suffering the sinking of its ships and the destruction of its one warehouse.  Duncannon Fort became less relevant by the century, and became finally and formally non-military in 1986.  It is now a museum, art gallery, and restaurant, all well repaying a visit. Tides locally are complicated Local HW / LW at Dunmore East and Slade and the outer parts of the estuary are at Cobh +0015, though obviously this is progressively later the further up.  In fact HW is Cobh +0100 at Waterford itself, is Cobh +0040 at New Ross, and Cobh +0110 at St. Mullins S724-385, which is about as far up as the salt water goes and the limit of navigability in the river Barrow for sea-going craft. The E side of the immediate Hook area has no significant tidal movement, though there seems always to be clapotis off Baginbun Head S803-030. In the wide S parts of the estuary of Waterford Harbour on the W side of the Hook:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The flood in the main channel of the wide part of the Harbour runs from Cobh -0425 to +0045 and ebbs from Cobh +0045 to -0425.It generally achieves 0.75 on the ingoing flood and 1.5kn on the outgoing ebb.  The ebb in southerlies therefore gives highly sporting deep water surfing, particularly from Credaun Head S718-036 up to Duncannon, but mind the shipping.  These are busy waters.</li>\n<li>The ingoing flood, as far as Credaun Head, is strong along the W side, during which there may be slack or even a weak outgoing flow on the E side.</li>\n<li>Squeezing past Credaun Head itself, the floood reaches 2.5kn or 3.0kn.</li>\n<li>The outgoing ebb, between Duncannon and Hook Head, sets mainly along the E side, and gets very strong along the W shore of the Hook.</li>\n<li>The tail end of the outgoing ebb eddies at Credaun Head, as far as Portally Head 6<em>km</em> SW.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further up the rivers, the flood and ebb start a little later.  At St. Mullins the ebb starts at Cobh +0200.  For trip planning it is important to gain every last advantage of the tidal flow, especially in wintertime when daylight is limited. Outside, beyond the mouth of the estuary, the main E going stream floods from Cobh -0120 to +0450.  Close inshore the E going flood and W going ebb start an hour or so earlier at about HW Cobh -0200 and +0400. At Hook Head itself, the “Tower Race” sets up on the ebb.  It starts at the point of the headland and extends seaward for 2 / 3<em>km</em>.  Its workings are very complicated, perhaps especially when the estuary is emptying into an oncoming ebb, with wind over.  The combined tides set up a rotary eddy system, so the resulting direction of the run off at the Head varies enormously.  These very powerful hydraulics should be avoided by small boats in adverse conditions. <em>Oileáin 2013</em> sets it out in tabular format : <strong>Waterford Harbour</strong></p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Off Waterford Harbour entrance</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">1:20 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:50 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>At the Head itself, the west-going stream starts an hour earlier at 3:50 after Cobh HW. <strong>The Tower Race</strong> The Tower Race starts just south of the headland and extends westward for 2 / 3km on the ebb.

Nevertheless, no matter how lazy, do not leave a car here.  The tide does return.  Launching / landing at LW is best on the N end of the beach for the shortest carry. Beware also that the shipping lanes in the estuary hereabouts are tight into this side.  They run strongest immediately off the headland just NW the beach, on which is perched Duncannon Fort.

That way you get ther entire of the ebb all the way, and the upper parts of the river are in deepwater mode, which is way more attractive to the average passing small boatman.  If the river is in flood there is always an ebb flow in an estuary, so start even earlier to gain even more tidal advantage.  A trip of this kind requires a shuttle, so maybe plan to leave even more time, say 90 minutes, against human weakness. The river changes subtly as you move along  – starting in a forested river valley with steep sides.  It is necessary to keep up at least 10<em>km</em> over the ground, and the get out spots are few and far between (mud, ooze, goo), so the party needs to be of unified purpose. The river begins to flatten out into a meandering flow around where the Nore joins in, about 4<em>km</em> above New Ross. The first obvious stop is at New Ross Boat Club S717-278, just NNW of the bridge, on river right, where normally the gate is locked, but for access for genuine club trips, e-mail in advance<a href=\"mailto:marina@newrosstc.ie\">marina@newrosstc.ie</a> Marina Manager, New Ross Town Council. Lunch. Then inspect the MV Dunbrody on river left, still in New Ross, a replica “famine ship” built in the 1990s to commemorate the ships of the 1840s in which so many Irish travelled to the new world when things collapsed locally. The Suir joins in a further 17<em>km</em> downriver and the bigger commercial shipping picks up, necessitating greater concentration.  Something may appear at speed from in front or behind, or from the side at Passage East, but then Duncannon lies ahead. Finish.  43<em>km</em> overall.</p>\n",

The dune system with its back strand is a wonderful natural area, the beach is a surfer’s paradise, and the town has every amusement known to the holiday maker.  Use the pier in Tramore S576-004 for exploring the islands and coast west of Tramore. There is parking for a few cars on the pier and a good slipway. More parking is available a bit up the road. West of Tramore to at least Stradbally lies a particularly interesting stretch of coast that is very varied and interesting, comprising sea cliffs, groups of stacks, caves, arches and storm beaches that provide much visual interest. There is much to explore, and the geology is notable.  The rock is mostly red sandstone or conglomerate, and the coast has a history of mining for copper in the 1800’s, the “Copper Coast”. Some of the ventilation shafts are visible from the sea. The islands for the most part are steep and precipitous sea stacks with landings only onto rock shelves. The challenge is to summit and many require a party with some rock climbing experience.  The shore as far as Dungarvan is dealt with here cove by cove and island by island, always heading westwards.

It is known locally as “The Island” or even to some as “Goat Island”. The grass-topped inner island is the largest and is reachable on foot at LW springs. The outer rocks are pleasant to explore for their gaps, passages and small cliffs. The inner gap is a welcome escape route on passage and is usually navigable. Land in or about the gap itself onto sheltered rocks. Landing and Embarkation Land in or about the gap itself onto sheltered rocks. Embark from the ‘new’ pier at Helvick at X313-892 – <em>Cé Heilbhic</em> where there is easy parking and launching beside the RNLI station inside the harbour. Toilets and water are available. <strong>Round of Mine Head</strong> Helvick is also the popular launching or landing spot at the E end of the round of Mine Head – <em>Mionn Árd</em>. Launch at the W end of this trip at a sheltered beach, either at Ardmore itself or nearer at X205-798. The journey may be broken at any of the many sandy beaches and coves, subject to conditions on the day. At a small rock Carrignanean X290-834, there is an interesting expedition for anyone who wants to land on the rocks on the S facing side of the small headland. You can scramble up a small gulley and grass slope and visit an important megalithic court cairn tomb. The scrambling takes a bit of effort but is worth the effort. The tomb at Ballynamona is a court cairn and is the only example of its kind in the SE. This type is usually found N of a line between Clew Bay in the W and Dundalk in the E. It would have been constructed by a tribal group and an immense amount of social organisation was required in its building. There would have been many burials in the grave. The bodies were burnt and the cremated bones were placed in the burial chambers, sometimes with pottery, beads, stone, bone, and tools for use in the next life. Ballynamona was excavated in May 1938 by a team lead by T.G.E. Powell, as part of relief of unemployment programme of excavations administered by the OPW in collaboration with the National Museum. Because it had been plundered for fencing material it proved impossible for the excavators to estimate its original size. The chamber deposits had been destroyed by treasure seekers. However, some small fragments of highly decorated pottery were found, as were numerous natural flint flakes, some of which showed traces of human working. A small stone disc was also found. It is made of a fine-grained piece of Old Red sandstone. Similar larger discs are known from gallery graves in Brittany, Scotland, Wales and Co. Wicklow. We do not know the beliefs of the builders of the tomb but there is evidence that they were sun worshippers, at least in some parts of Ireland. But whatever their beliefs they were compelling, as similar structures are found all over Europe and in part of Africa and Asia. Although the Ballynamona Court Cairn is neither spectacular nor large its importance cannot be overlooked. It is known to date from 2000 B.C. during the late Neolithic or early Bronze Age. It is clear evidence of the early settlement of Old Parish by a developed, agricultural society. Other evidence of settlement in Co. Waterford from this period are the nearest known megalithic tombs at Gaulstown, Mattewstown and Ballynageeragh in or around the Tramore area, and an important find of an uncommonly fine, polished stone implement at Aglish, Co. Waterford, presently in the National Museum. While this grave was still in use the Late Stone Age was drawing to a close. The Early Bronze Age, in which implements of bronze and copper were manufactured, saw the arrival in Ireland of prospectors and metal workers, who found Co. Waterford rich in the necessary metal deposits. At Bonmahon, copper was mined and there is some evidence that a foundry or factory of bronze implements existed on the edge of Knockmon bog, west of Dungarvan. Mine Head is the highest lighthouse in Ireland, but the kayak on passage will not see it from immediately below because it is set back from the cliff edge. The only escape on the 15<em>km</em> passage is at Ballymacart Cove at X253-810, perhaps too close to the Ardmore end to be practical. Too close maybe to the other end is a beautiful beach known locally as <em>Faill na Staicín</em> at X298-877. <strong>County Cork</strong> <strong>Tidal Overview – Cork SE</strong> Tides are generally weak between Cork Harbour in the W and Knockadoon Head, 30<em>km</em> to the ENE. However, there are significant races off the headlands and in the sounds between the islands (Ballycotton Sound and Capel Sound), where 2<em>kn</em> is achieved. Slack water is thought by local paddlers to be at much the same time as LW/HW Cork. In Youghal Bay, southerly winds raise a heavy sea, and the tidal streams are rotary and very complex, running strongly over the bar, which is in midbay directly S of the river entrance, so caution should be exercised.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Capel Island</strong> X100-700          Sheet 81 This attractive, 37m high island is just off Knockadoon Head, which separates Ballycotton Bay from Youghal Bay. It is privately owned but became (mostly) a Birdwatch Ireland nature reserve in 1994. The stub of an unfinished lighthouse on its highest point dominates the island. Stone walls surround the building, and a small, square out-house is worth investigating to see the dramatic drop from the hole in its floor. The seaward side of the island is most attractive and there is a colony of breeding Cormorant (60 pairs in 1995) at the SW corner. Otter are also present. There is no water, and a possible deterrent to camping is a herd of goats. There were 30 or so in 1995, only 12 in 2002. In 2010, the lighthouse now has a locked gate. Embarkation There is a pier and slipway at X092-703 for embarkation at Knockadoon Head where there are two well-sheltered beaches. The only water hereabouts is at houses and the local Dominican summer school camp, and the nearest shops and facilities are at Ballymacoda, 5<em>km</em> to the W. Given the proximity of the island to Knockadoon Head local kayakers usually paddle across from Youghal. There is excellent parking and short carry at Ferrypoint X116-778 on the Waterford side of the Blackwater River opposite Youghal. It makes for a nice paddle to Capel Island. About 8<em>km_each way. Landing A low headland projects NW from mid-NW side of the island. There are beaches at either side of the base of this headland. The beach to the SW side (on a direct line between Knockadoon Pier and the tower on the island) does not exist at HW and is more exposed, but access to the interior is easier. The beach to the NE side does not exist at HW and access to the interior is scramblier. At HW, a deep-water landing may be had onto rocks on the sheltered cove E of this headland. Tides Local HW/LW are as Cork. So is slack, according to local paddlers. A fierce tide runs through Capel Island Sound. In Youghal Bay, southerly winds raise a heavy sea. The coastline westward to the beach at Ballymakeagh at X050-688 is very pleasant, and there are great views eastwards to Ardmore and Helvick. Knockadoon Head was the fastest developing rock climbing crag in Ireland in 2003.  It remains a popular low season target of opportunity for its sunny south facing aspect. <strong>Ballycotton Islands</strong> There are two contrasting islands lying just off the coast from Ballycotton village in E Cork. Embarkation Embarkation is best from a small slipway at the village where there is a small field in which to park, and a very easy gradient yielding a short carry of 50-100m maximum. This is about 1_km</em> WNW of the harbour, opposite the Garda barracks. It is reached by a laneway beside a shop at W989-643. There is water available here and also at the harbour from public taps. Ballycotton has good facilities, B&amp;Bs, pubs and restaurants. The harbour itself is slightly further E at W999-637. Launching is difficult, but is possible from either of two slipways reached by narrow, steep alleyways. Descent to the beach is also possible behind the toilets on the main pier. In addition, there are steep, narrow steps halfway down the outside (E) of the pier which gives awkward access to a small beach. The W pier of the harbour is little more than a breakwater. Tides In Ballycotton Sound and between the inner island and the coast, 2<em>kn</em> is achieved,. Slack water is thought by local paddlers to be much as for LW/HW Cork.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p>runs towards Deepwater Quay at Cobh.</p>\n<p><strong>Great Island</strong> W805-665          Sheet 87 / Sheet 81 This island is unique amongst Irish islands in having a large town, Cobh. The island is located in the centre of Cork Harbour and is dominated on its southern flank by the town of Cobh. It is joined to Fota Island in the NE by a short bridge at Belvelly at W791-708. Access has improved in recent years with the introduction of a passenger and vehicle ferry between Carrigaloe and Passage West at W772-675, thereby shortening road travel time to Cork City. The island has a long history of human settlement dating back to the Phoenicians, but owes much of its development to its fine natural harbour. Its naval importance and its use as a port for transatlantic liners has left the town with a long nautical association. Much of the town’s fine architecture dates from the early 1800’s. Historic attractions include a fine cathedral, Cobh Heritage Centre and Old Church Graveyard, where many of the victims of the Lusitania are buried. The town’s long association with the White Star Line’s Titanic and Mauritania has been re-kindled recently with the opening of the Titanic Rooms bar and restaurant in what was the old White Star Line Shipping Offices. Great Island is 7<em>km</em> long by 4<em>km</em> wide. The geology is Old Red Sandstone overlaid with Limestone in the valleys. The northern shorelines are estuarine, and the island is separated from the mainland at its western and eastern flanks by two river gorges. A full circumnavigation is an interesting day’s paddling, bringing the kayaker through urban, industrial, estuarine, agricultural and scenic landscapes. Circumnavigation Embarkation for a circumnavigation is recommended from White Point at W786-658 or alternatively at any of several slipways in Cobh, perhaps the best of which is under the town clock directly opposite Eddie English’s Sail Training Centre at W805-665. It is recommended to follow a clockwise route around. The entire distance is about 27<em>km</em>, or 5 hours paddling, but allow for stops. Tides Tidal flows in the river gorges (W and E sides) run to 3<em>kn</em> in springs but these can be utilised to advantage in the timing of one’s passage. The critical factors in a circumnavigation are (a) to pass close enough to HW where the tides meet, which is under Belvelly Bridge W791-707, and (b) to clear Rosslague Point at W800-703 just to its E before the ebb exposes the mudflats. A trip in spring/autumn/winter is best from a natural history point of view as both Lough Mahon to the NW and the North Channel have large numbers of ducks and waders to provide interest. The western river passage is a busy shipping lane to Ringaskiddy Port and Cork City. Care is required passing the old dockyard at Rushbrooke and IFI fertiliser jetties at Marino Point at W772-694. The Ro/Ro ferry service at Carrigaloe-Passage West also moves surprisingly quickly. Camping Camping is possible and quite pleasant from Ashgrove at W860-696 at the NE point, to East Ferry, to Morlogue Point at W852-672 at the SE point. Water is not available but the area is pleasantly wooded and there are several grassy fields that are quite remote. The eastern river passage down to East Ferry is quite scenic and one has a choice of two hostelries for lunch. The Morlogue Inn at W853-683 is situated on the Great Island side about halfway down and Murphy’s Bar is on the mainland opposite. Once around Morlogue Point at W852-672, passage is westward towards Cobh. A Birdwatch Ireland nature reserve is located at Cuskinny Bay at W818-673. The Spit Bank Lighthouse at W812-658 marks the edge of the Spit Bank and is worth a detour. The tidal flow is weaker on the Spit Bank and gives better views of Cobh than the main channel, being that bit out and thereby gaining perspective. Spike Island at W805-645 and Haulbowline Island at W789-655 dominate the views to the S.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Haulbowline Island</strong> W789-655          Sheet 87 A small island located just S of Cobh town in Cork Harbour. As the name suggests the island has naval associations and the island is totally dominated by buildings of the Naval Service on its western side, the National Maritime College and University College Cork Marine Research Centre. . Many of these buildings date from the 1700-1800’s when Cork Harbour was a significant port of the British Navy. The oldest buildings face Great Island and a Martello Tower at W789-655 dominates the island’s highest point. The E end is spoilt by the decaying remains of Irish Steel, a major steel manufacturing company which for many years ran its operation here, but became bankrupt a few years ago, and operations ceased 2001. The extreme E side is reclaimed polder on which the slag and spoil from this industrial site was dumped. The Naval Basin is also on the E side of the island and kayakers can enter to view the ships of the Irish Naval Service. Landing Landing is not encouraged but is possible at several slipways on the southern side and in the Naval Basin. Ferries run from Cobh to piers on the northern side for Naval personnel. Small boats should be wary of these when passing along the northern edge. The NW corner of the island juts out into the main shipping channel between Cork city docks and the ferry port at Ringaskiddy, so kayakers rounding this point should be careful at all times. Tides The main river channel from Cork City and the ferry port at Ringaskiddy flows through a narrow passage between Haulbowline and White Point on Great Island just NW. The tidal flow achieves 2<em>kn</em> at this point. The main tidal flow splits at Haulbowline with the much lesser flow running along the southern side of the island. Future Ambitious plans for cleaning up and developing the whole island to a standard to rival Dublin’s Irish Financial Services Centre were announced 2006.  If these come to pass, the island will have apartments, hotels, offices, marinas, everything the well appointred Irish island really needs.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Spike Island</strong> W805-645          Sheet 87 / Sheet 81 This island is located very close to the centre of Cork Harbour and the distinctive flat-topped fort dominating the island was until recently a civilian prison. The island is a good rest/lunch area for kayakers touring the harbour area. Most of the rest of the island apart from the extensive fort is grassland with some copses of Scots Pine along the N and W sides. The E and S sides are steeper with scrub and furze dominating the vegetation. Landings are possible at most points of the island but probably best at the NE corner at W807-649 near a very large limestone warehouse. A ferry service for Military and Prison staff runs from Cobh to the island pier at the NW corner at W800-648. The island’s history is largely military because of its strategic position and the importance of Cork Harbour in British Naval history. The island commands the approaches to the outer and inner harbour and formed a triangle of defence with the twin forts of Camden at W809-618 and Carlisle at W819-624, located on either side of the narrowest part of the entrance to the harbour. Spike Island has a distinctive flat-topped appearance due to the presence of its large sunken fort. The fort has witnessed various uses by both the British and Irish governments ranging from Internment Centres to Military Prisons and Military Training Areas. The island was also used occasionally as a Quarantine Zone for imported livestock.  Current plans for the intensified use of the island include a prison, but with a land bridge, as the ferry cost was a major factor shutting the prison in the past. On the N side facing Cobh, there are many old military style houses and storage areas. Most of these buildings are now in an advanced state of disrepair. The foreshore is predominantly shingle and stony beaches and the area between Ringaskiddy Point at W794-647 and the western shore dries out to expose large areas of muddy estuary. However, the route is navigable by kayak at all stages of the tide. Tides The Spit Bank lies off the island’s northern shore and is marked at its NE edge by the Spit Bank lighthouse at W812-658. Tidal flow on the bank is less than in the main harbour channels and may be useful to kayakers travelling up or down river against the flow. Landing Traditionally, landings have not been encouraged. The military had sentries posted at all points to deny access. However, this practice has been relaxed in recent years and kayakers remaining away from the main fort area have not been challenged. <strong>Cork SW</strong> Tidal Overview Off the coast from Cork Harbour to the Fastnet, the tidal streams achieve 1.0 – 1.5kn in springs and eddy strongly at the headlands.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Cork to Fastnet</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"66\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:20 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">1-1.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">1:50 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">1-1.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Be aware that the tide inshore, particularly at headlands is often seen to change an hour or more earlier than the times above. <strong>Access</strong> Heading west from Cork Harbour the coastline is dominated by cliffs of sediments with the only real shelter provided by the river mouths of The Slick at Oysterhaven, the Bandon at Kinsale and the Argideen at Coolmain Bay.  Otherwise landings are few enough and road access to a landing a rarity.  As a result of this limited access to the coast, there is inevitably a small settlement at each of these coves. Islands too are few, so coves and bays and islands are presented here in the order in which they appear to the westbound traveller.</p>\n",

There is the remains of a structure on top the lower half, and in 2012 a fixed rope to aid in descent. The two parts are separated by a fine creek, in width about the length of a small boat.  In places the ascent requires pure rock climbing up attractive corner features.  Lovely when accessible, definitely a place to tarry a while. The landings on both islands are onto rocky platforms and on the larger and more precipitous W islet are best at either the SE or SW corner if wanting to gain direct access to the summit. Other areas are easier, such as a small inlet on the NE, but require very good rock climbing skills to progress further. The E islet is best landed on its NE corner in a small cove. The shelving rocks are slippery and covered in green algae so care required especially on the descent. Breeding colonies of Cormorants, Herring and Greater-black backed Gulls.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Old Head of Kinsale</strong> W625-406          Sheet 87 This mighty headland extends 7<em>km</em> out to sea, W of Cork Harbour. Magnificent and rocky, it boasts a golf course over almost the entirety of its outer parts. This is said to be among the finest golf courses in the world.  Public access through the golf course and the lighthouse at the tip was disputed. It was claimed, unsuccessfully, that a traditional right of way existed historically. There was a rock-climbing crag at the head itself, now therefore disused. The grid reference given is for a narrow neck halfway out, to the E and W of which are Holeopen Bay, E and W respectively. Through this narrow section, S of which lies the golf course, run three caves. One (narrow but deep) is kayak friendly and should in most conditions allow passing kayaks to avoid the rounding of the headland itself. One (broad but bouldery) might also do so at HW. A third allowed researchers a glimpse of light and might require cool nerves. The caves are immediately inside a prominent sea stack on the W side, and under the golf course flagpoles on the E side. Cliffy and gorgeous, do not readily pass by without a visit. Embarkation Put in on the E side at either the muddy beach just NW of a pier close to the Speckled Door pub at W619-434, or,  which may offer a quieter alternative, at a small beach W620-438 about 400<em>m</em> W of Blackrock point. The beach is well protected by offlying skerries and has a shallow slope. On the W side, Whitestrand may offer a slightly calmer launching  / landing place than Garretstown beach. It is a sandy beach backed by an hotel at W610-430. From any such option, the shuttle is only about 2<em>km</em>, easily walkable. Tides Expect clapotis on the windward/uptide side. Major eddies set up at the head – the flow is always to the south on both sides close in. These collide with the mainstream at the head, so expect a race off the head itself and up to 2km downstream. It is reported that when winds are calm enough or from other than the southern quadrant, the mainstream race stays off the tip itself, somewhat out to sea, so that kayaks may scrape past on the inside.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Old Head of Kinsale</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:20 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:05 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The flows may change earlier.

Launch at a slipway on the northern shore. Commercial kayak businesses need a permit to operate on it. The Heritage centre in Skibbereen has a great video and touch tank to do with the lough and well worth a visit to learn about it. Good car parking.  No camping allowed. The interest of the lough to scientists lies in its deep, tidal, salt water in a controlled environment. Academics from universities all over Europe come to research the marine life to be found in the lough and its rapids. For instance, the lough boasts the biggest scallops found anywhere. It is much loved by divers, as depths of 45m can be had with good visibility close to the shore in a sheltered environment, although any disturbance of the silty bottom soon puts an end to the visibility. The necessary authorisation/permit may be had locally. The lough is famous for its night paddles, as there is excellent phosphorescence in the sheltered water. Tides The narrow entrance is known as The Rapids. The Lough fills for 4 hours and empties for the remaining 8 hours.  Typical of such a formation, the outgoing stream continues long after the tide outside has started to rise; the same happens in reverse although it is less pronounced.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"251\"><strong>Lough Hyne Rapids</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"173\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">3:20 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">6kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">1:15 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">6kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Local HW is about 20 minutes before Cobh.

The arch at the SE doesn’t go.  Roost for many seagulls and seabirds.  Mighty cliffs all round. The arch in the mainland headland immediately N does go for the brave in good conditions.  The narrow sound between island and mainland has a couple of rocks mid-channel and the flow speeds up through the gaps, cutting rough with wind over, so is is worth watching. Launch from nearest point Trafraska W054-254, a sheltered inlet E of Baltimore and 1.5km NW. <strong>West Cork</strong> <strong>Roaringwater Bay to the Beara Peninsula</strong> <strong>County Cork</strong> <strong>Roaringwater Bay</strong> Roaringwater Bay, in the extreme SW of Ireland, is excessively named. In fact, its many islands guarantee sheltered water in almost all conditions. Its userfriendly aspect makes it a most popular area for watersports and boating. The area generally tends to be very popular in summer, because there is always somewhere to hide in Roaringwater Bay. From Sherkin and Cape Clear Islands in the S to Mizen Head in the W, it is more accurately called Long Island Bay. Roaringwater Bay proper is tucked into the sheltered NE corner. A feature of virtually all the islands, caused by their sandstone geology, is ‘waisting’. Waists are narrow points where the islands are almost cut in two, and sometimes three, by the sea. Indeed, they may soon be. These waists are heavily relied on in the text for locational descriptions. -Beaches or landing points, and other places, are often located by reference to the waist. This waisting is not always obvious from a casual glance at the halfinch OS map, but the modern OS 1:50,000, sheet 88 does much better. Embarkation The many islands of the bay are reached from the pretty towns of Baltimore to the SE or Schull to the NW. Each town boasts every possible convenience to the holidaymaker. Here, as elsewhere in the region, the standard of pub and restaurant food is superb. Hostels and accommodation of all kind abound. Vehicles may conveniently be left in either location. Both towns are famous for their sailing schools, Baltimore having the edge perhaps. Baltimore has a regular year-round ferry to Sherkin and Cape Clear Islands. There is a ferry to Cape Clear Island in summer from Schull. Technically the nearest launch for Cape Clear is Colla Pier V917-293, a pleasant spot, a refuge in campervannable terms from Schull. Tides The big picture is that the flood flows E from Mizen Head through the islands of the bay, and outside Cape Clear Island. Among the islands of the bay, the flood generally turns S and then E where circumstances suggest. In this way, the flood runs E along both the N and S sides of the islands, and generally S through sounds that run N/S. The reverse is also true, the ebb flowing generally W and N through the sounds. This is particularly true of Gascanane Sound, between Sherkin and Cape Clear. Important and predictable exceptions occur. The flood streams N through the sound between Long Island and Castle Island and ebbs S. This allows the large enclosed water area of Schull Harbour to the N to be filled and emptied. In the same way, the large enclosed water area of Baltimore Harbour fills from both sides, N and S. In the sound between Sherkin and the mainland, the flood is N and the ebb is S.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Piratical Baltimore</strong> W028-257          Sheet 88 The ancient native Irish were comprehensively crushed in the military sense in 1601 with the battle of Kinsale.  The pacification of the countryside meant the land was ripe for settlement by the victors. Farming would follow the fighting, in a common pattern, here as elsewhere. Pretty seaside Baltimore was among the earliest of villages ‘planted’ with residents of English, Irish and Danish origins. Mostly they fished. On 20<sup>th</sup> June 1631, the village had 26 huts in concentric circles, stone fireplaces, but the rest was made of straw. In a pirate raid unequalled before or after, Baltimore had 235 less residents at sundown than at dawn. The 235 were taken by Barbary corsairs out of Algiers in a dawn raid. With a local pilot and a fair skinned Dutch commander, these oriental pillagers came ashore, burnt out the entire village and took away the villagers. There were two ships and 280 fighting men among the corsairs, of whom 230 went ashore. They set the roofs afire with tar torches and created lots of noise to confuse – 17<sup>th</sup> century ‘shock &amp; awe’. They took everyone, from the elderly to the youngest babies, who would become maids and then ‘whatever’. Two elderly and therefore uneconomic adults were sent back from the ships before they sailed. 23 men were taken and the rest were women and children. Fair skinned Celtic women were then as now greatly prized in North Africa (as they are in Ireland) and commanded high prices. The slaves were treated well on the whole and only the wealthy were abused so that their entreaties home for ransom might be the more urgent. Such piracy was then commonplace, even commonly carried out by the British and other European states. One William Gunther ran a populist campaign that managed to shock Westminster with the scale of the Baltimore raid and keep the candle burning. Only one captive ever made it home, Joan Broadbrook, not entirely a happy occurrence.  Male “liberated” captives in such circumstances have typically fared well enough, while “returned” females have always been shunned, throughout history, worldwide.  Statistically, 10% of all Algerians are fair skinned..</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Sherkin Island</strong> W028-257          Sheet 88 Population 90. Embarkation and Landing The pier in Baltimore Harbour is the embarkation place for the island. During busy periods the strand 0.5km southwest on the edge of town W043-260 can be less fussy, and the parking is fine.  The main pier on Sherkin is on the E side of the island just below the abbey, all clearly visible from Baltimore. There is a water tap on the pier. The strand on the S side of the pier is a very sheltered, stony beach. Camping Prominent, ivy-clad O’Driscoll Castle stands 300m N of the pier. Below the castle is a very steep slipway, and above the castle is the hotel. The best camping is above the slipway. It is best to ask in the hotel. There is another water tap just outside the hotel and below ‘The Jolly Roger’ pub. Circumnavigation The Globe Rocks, awash at LW, are just N of the pier. The sound at the NW of the island between it and Spanish Island is called ‘The Sound’. Dock Pier is just W of the N entrance to The Sound, in a safe, well-sheltered ENE-facing cove at W023-273. Along the whole N side of the island, beware of the Cape Clear Island ferry, as the depth is shallow and the boats are very frequent in summer. Many yachts will also be encountered, many of which are being driven by beginners, and further care is needed in that regard. The very sheltered Kinish Harbour on the NW side, which mostly dries, has a mighty current, perhaps 2kn, at the entrance at W017-259. Beware of Carrogoona Rocks just E of the entrance. It is only a 150m carry to Cow Strand at W014-253 from the quay at the SW side of the harbour. W of the entrance to Kinish Harbour is the Sherkin Island Marine Station. The landing point at W010-259 involves a lot of weaving in between offshore rocks but the landing itself is quite sheltered. The Marine Station, in addition to its research activities, privately publishes works on bird life and natural sciences, particularly aquatic flora and fauna. Especially recommended is their ‘Ireland’s Marine Life, A World of Beauty’, a stunning collection of underwater pictures taken locally in Roaringwater Bay. The price at time of writing was €20.00, plus postage. Contact them on 028 20187 or by e-mail at SherkinMarine@eircom.net. Cow Strand is the more southerly and smaller of two strands in the large curved bay on the W part of the N side of the island. It is a bit public in summer but a great spot nonetheless. Silver Strand at W012-255 is just to the N of Cow Strand. It is probably the best beach on the island and camping is to be had in the cliffs at the S end. Above both beaches, an islander collects modest camping fees. Both beaches slope gently and attract big swells, getting dangerous when the wind is SW to NW. 3-400m S of Cow Strand is Priest’s Bay at W012-247, which is very secluded. SW of Priest’s Bay is the nice, crescent-shaped, sheltered Trabaun Strand at W010-245. On an anticlockwise trip around, the coast from here to the well-named Horseshoe Harbour at W027-254 is more or less inaccessible all the way. An exception may be Tracrua at W003-240, a narrow inlet just S of Sherkin Point. Horseshoe Harbour lies just W of the sound to the E of the island, very near everything and very secluded. The rocky landing is in at the back. Tides Baltimore Harbour fills from both the northwest and from the south. These flood streams meet near Lousy Rocks in the middle of the harbour. The tidal stream floods east on both the northern and southern sides of Sherkin Island. After that, the combined stream heads east and then northeast into Church Strand Bay, northeast of the town.

        "description": "<p><strong>Cape Clear Island – <em>Oileán Cléire</em></strong> V954-218          Sheet 88 This Gaeltacht island is truly the Land’s End of SW Ireland. Cape Clear is actually the most SW point of Cape Clear Island, called Pointabullaun at V943-197. Mountainous, steep, and imposing, the island is home in winter to about 135 people or 110 voters and many more in summer. A ferry runs all year from Baltimore – twice daily in winter, more often in summer. In summer, there is also a ferry from Schull. The island has pubs, B&amp;Bs, restaurants, two hostels, a well-appointed campsite at V954-212, windmills, very basic shops and provisions, and the most famous bird observatory in the country at V954-219. The island is extremely waisted, the waist being known as ‘The Waist’, with the North Harbour to landward, and South Harbour on the seaward side. The waist itself is high and narrow, and the roads in the vicinity of the waist are extremely steep, that giving access to the E end of the island being called the A1 and having a gradient of about 1:4. The co-operative club serves excellent meals and drink on the harbour, and Cotter’s Bar is also located here. There is a third wee pub up at the waist. A fourth, modern pub, Danny Mike’s, has been built just S of the waist, and excellent food may be had from breakfast to dinner time. “<em>Dún an Óir</em>” (Gold Fort) is the mediaeval castle on the projecting headland just WSW of the North Harbour. On private land, it was once an influential affair under the O’Driscolls, who ruled locally. The Spanish came in 1601 under Don Juan del Aquila. After the defeat of Gaelic Ireland in Kinsale that year, the castle, and Ireland generally, not to mention the Spanish, fell into decline. There is the ruin of a lighthouse on the middle summit, which was the main landfall light for ships arriving from America during most of the 19th Century. Its light was too high up, and therefore too often obscured by fog. It was decided, after 100 lives were lost in a shipwreck in 1847, to build a lighthouse on the Fastnet Rock. Incoming liners long ago passed by the island, and the passengers would toss messages overboard in sealed containers.  These were forwarded from the signal station and arrived in London hours before the ship.  The islanders were first in Europe to hear of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. The island would repay a fortnight’s visit, and the walking repays fitness. Landing The main landing is at the beach in the well-sheltered pier in North Harbour, where the ferry comes in. For a fleeting visit, land on the sandy beach, dead ahead of the harbour entrance. For longer visits, consider the remoter mud/shingle beach under the bird observatory in the inner harbour, hard right just inside the harbour entrance. Should conditions allow, landing is also very sheltered in South Harbour. Land here easiest at the stony beach on the E side, inside the lovely old quay and under the youth hostel at V958-213. Circumnavigation A circumnavigation is a committing 15<em>km</em> and requires good conditions and planning. Note particularly that the tidal timings vary at each end of the island. The crux of the trip will always be off Cape Clear itself, W of South Harbour, but Gascanane Sound may provide technical interest also. Begin and end at North or South Harbour. Landings, as waystops only, may be had on the N side, where roads are shown going down to the sea, near the little rocky island Illauneana (V970-235). Both are stony landings, that to the E being steep also. The landing apparent on the map at V984-230 on the E side is very difficult. It is an exposed, steep slipway, impossible without good conditions and best avoided. There are no landings on the SE side, nor W of South Harbour round to North Harbour. There is a mighty sea arch at Pointanbullig on the E side of the South Harbour entrance. Camping The main camping is a well-appointed campsite at V954-212. For kayakers, this is inconvenient to the North Harbour, involving a long carry past the waist. Better by far is to land in South Harbour, on the W side, under the campsite. The only possible camping ‘sauvage’ may be had inconveniently, on the N side where roads are shown going down to the sea, near the little rocky island Illauneana (V970-235). Nothing is known as to availability of water. Hostels B&amp;B and a hostel may be had at Cotter’s Bar, just above the main pier. There is an ‘An Oige’ youth hostel at the South Harbour at V958-213. Those landing here will be well rewarded for their extra effort in terms of the welcome, as an outdoor pursuits centre runs from the hostel called ‘Cleire Lasmuigh’ or in the English, ‘Cape Clear Island Outdoors Activity’. Calm conditions are needed to paddle around to this spot. Birding At the pier in North Harbour is the Bird Observatory building, like a youth hostel. This (in season) is strictly for birders. The birding season locally is the autumn months of August through to November, so paddlers may be welcome at other times. Even in season, especially for those possessing binoculars and who know a covert from a supercilium, it may be worth asking. When a new “first” (such as Yellow Bellied Sapsucker or Red Eyed Vireo, to name recent samples) gets reported on the bird grapevine, the island becomes suddenly thronged with highly motivated, intensely competitive individuals. They have all abandoned faraway families and jobs with zero notice, here to see, “tick” and “twitch” on the avian wonder that has dropped in. These people are not dangerous when approached, even when they occur in numbers. However, as they have no interest in those outside their own kind, they will mostly ignore you, so there is little point, and anyway they speak a language all their own. Because of its extreme SW position, Cape Clear Island is directly in the path of long distance birds and cetaceans gaining and regaining the North Atlantic from all points E and S. Accordingly, Cape Clear is internationally famous for its migrants and vagrants, and virtually nowhere else in the country has as many rarities, and mega-rarities. Most bird observation is done near the waist and on the W end of the island. Dawn and dusk sea-watching of both birds and cetaceans is done mostly from Blananarragaun at V947-197, which juts out at the extreme S tip of the island. Get there by following a path along the top of the cliffs on the W side of South Harbour. When approaching, it appears inaccessible, but keep your nerve, it is easy enough to scramble out. Morning or evening, this is one spot you will never have to yourself. The area just behind the Youth Hostel is also a renowned birding spot, especially for the smaller passerines, and much ringing and counting takes place hereabouts. Good birds are seen further E on the island as well, especially on the N side, among the sheltered wooded spots. Climbing There is excellent rock climbing on the Bill of Clear, thin, well-protected slabs, and some steeper work, with plenty of scope remaining.

The northern branch is uncomplicated. The southern branch sets up heavy confused seas as it continues to Blananarragaun, the point 1.5km to the southeast, which juts out from the southern tip. After Blananarragaun, it makes a big eddy anticlockwise around the outer part of South Harbour. On the ebb, there is a big eddy set up by Blananarragaun, clockwise to the Bill of Clear and back along the cliffs under Cape Clear. Thus, there is always a race off Blananarragaun when the tide is running and usually a heavy, confused sea state between Blananarragaun and the Bill of Clear.  It is all very confused and uncertain. Offshore to the mighty Fastnet, the tides run east/west.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Fastnet Rock – <em>Carraig Aonair</em></strong> V886-163          Sheet 88 Fastnet is remote. It lies about 20<em>km</em> from Baltimore or Schull. It is easiest reached from Cape Clear Island at about half that distance. The rock itself is 24m high and the lighthouse projects way beyond. It is a bleak, desolate place, its buildings all shuttered, its stairs and pathways steep and narrow and unprotected by maintained railings for the mostpart. A first attempt to build the lighthouse was in cast iron, completed in 1853. It wasn’t a success. In 1899, they began a granite replacement. This was first constructed in Cornwall of numbered blocks, 2,074 of them, weighing 3 – 5 tons each. These were then dismantled, taken to Rock Island, off Crookhaven, and reassembled. Then they were dismantled again, and reassembled again on the Fastnet. This was achieved without fatality, unusually in the Irish experience. The whole task was completed in 1904. Launch Schull and Baltimore are each the bones of 20km.  Nearest mainland launch as the crow flies is 13km at Galley Cove V788-247 at Crookhaven, or 14km from Colla Pier V916-293 outside Schull.  If possible, maybe break the journey in or out or both in Cape Clear Island at 9km.  Trip planning is a tension between getting the tidal flow right and not arriving at LW, if wanting to go ashore. Landing This is one of the more exposed lighthouse island landings, always subject to surge and scend. Certainly, few enough kayakers get here, because it is remote, but far fewer still go ashore, because to do so is so difficult. Fastnet is on a shallow shelf, always kicking up in the 200m or so around the rock. The landing platform is at the SE corner. Consider sending half the party ashore at a time, for safety. The steps for landing are approximately 01m proud of the water at LW. This has not been accurately measured, but a substantial height differential has been absolutely verified, so it complicates a slingshot approach to trip planning, where one would leave Cape Clear on the ebb, arrive at the Fastnet at LW and return on the start of the flood. Tides In prevailing westerlies, local kayakers agree it is perhaps best to do the whole thing on the flood. This allows one to arrive in plenty of time to land, take photos and rest before coming ‘home’ on the last of the flood.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Between Fastnet and Cape Clear</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"66\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:20 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">2.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">1:50 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">2.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>However, near the rock itself, it swerves more north / south as follows:</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Within 2km of the Fastnet</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"66\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">SSE</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:05 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">2.25kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">NNW</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:00 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">2.25kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>With westerly winds, the flood starts earlier and runs harder and the ebb starts earlier and runs harder in easterlies.

The ferry comes in at the extreme E point from Cunnamore Pier at W012-288 on the mainland opposite. Note the steps cut into the solid rock long before the modern pier was constructed.

Such buildings were always built of stone, which is not necessarily a weathertight arrangement.  The owners plastered the external walls top to bottom.  Whatever interaction took place between the old stone and the modern plaster, and there are many theories to be had on the subject, it is really not known how it all ended up the colour it did.  Certainly it cannot have been intentional.  At first a violent pinkish red, it has now faded in 2006 after a few years to a rusty orange. The parts of the island not covered by the castle and its ramparts have been planted with mixed forestry, and the conifers are faring better. There is road access to the island on the NE side, but kayakers will manage passage under it at all stages of the tide.  There is a pontoon arrangement by the bridge, on the island side. There is no obvious access point to this corner of the bay and certainly a quay up towards Ballydehob at W005-341 is awkward even for one car and not recommended.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Goat Island (Mór)</strong> V893-274          Sheet 88 The main Goat Island is ‘L’ shaped and has a ruined cottage and lazy beds on the eastern leg. Fences suggest recent grazing. Certainly, despite the lack of obvious grazing, in the summer of 95 the island was not overgrown. It was really quite inviting, a most attractive island. A deep-water landing may be had onto a natural but steep-sloping ramp at the E tip, just S of a prominent sea arch. At the join of the ‘L’, there is a sea arch where, except at the highest tides, there is a sand bank in the middle, but no reasonable access to the interior.  For a couple of hours either side of HW this makes for a lovely passage, highly recommended. Crookhaven / Galley Cove Galley Cove V788-246 is laid out as a picnic spot, but however it is mostly used as a wild camping site, and locals advise there is no problem with camping there. There are four individual slightly raised hardstand BBQ sites which are thereby dryer for tent pitching, and beside them is plenty of grass in good conditions. The site is between Galley Cove and (local name) Cockleshell Beach or White Strand (per the OS) V785-247 just across the road. Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.coastalhelicopterview.ie/\"><a href=\"http://www.coastalhelicopterview.ie\">http://www.coastalhelicopterview.ie</a></a> where the area is clearly visible from a few of the photos. It is a good mile walk along the road to Crookhaven, which has no footpath for most of it, and with a few blind corners, so it is nearly as easy to paddle down for provisions and a pint. Call into O’Sullivans on the pier in Crookhaven for local information. There is a small shop attached to O’Sullivans bar for basic provisions. Galley Cove is just about the closest accessible departure point to the Fastnet, and very suitable for aiming to get to Fastnet at HW (which would solve the LW “steps out of the water” issue). There are some lovely deep caves a short paddle around the corner West from Galley Cove, to the inside of Reen Point V790-242, the caves facing West. A nice short trip is a lap of Crookhaven starting and finishing on Cockleshell beach. The cars can be parked at Galley Cove and only require a short carry. Be sure to do it clockwise as there is a fantastic tunnel V817-255 through the waisting immediately inside Streek Head V819-255.  The entry is spectacular, and the exit is relatively sheltered, however if in any doubt, first go around the point to check it out. Mizen Head A place of strong tides, big seas and a real feeling of exposure. There is a super cave just below Mizen Head, on the South side, below the car park for the visitors centre at V740-235.  The cave faces West so can only be entered on very calm days. Very deep (150m perhaps) with loads of colours throughout, there is a beach at the very back which can have many seals resting on it.  Voted by locals to be a truly most spectacular cave. Day Tripping Launch nearest from Barley Cove on the East side, but the put in spot will vary with conditions.  More dependable is Galley Cove V792-246.  On the North side the position is far more uncertain.  The nearest haul out is at the infamous Dunlough Bay V739-265, which is exposed.  This was the scene of Ireland’s and Europe’s largest ever illegal drug smuggling seizure in 2012 when a RIB foundered in the bay, the petrol engine having been filled with diesel.  The slip is steep, there is an old windlass, a pier with steps, and seemingly always a surge. Quite exposed and a good distance in from a straight line crossing from Mizen to Three Castle Head, this only of use in exceptionally calm days, and not worth investigating in passing speculatively. From the carpark above the slip there is a lovely walk (20 odd minutes each way) to Three Caste Head.  The three castles are in a spectacular setting, well worth the trip. Access is across private lands, with a donation box for the upkeep. Toor Pier V749-283 is 3km beyond Three Castle Head and is only slightly the better option.  It too needs very gentle conditions, as otherwise the slip is very steep and overgrown.  It has a reputation as a boat eater, but seal launching plastic boats is quite possible.  Steps nearby are also smothered in weed, and it isn’t easy.  The pier is popular with divers, who can manage better.  Vehicular approach is a bit tedious.  There is no other safe option short of Dunmanus Harbour V848-333 at fully 10km ENE. Beware of a race between Mizen and Three Castle Head, especially with wind against tide.

        "description": "<p><strong>Illaunglass (West)</strong> V802-358          Sheet 88 Small craggy island located just off beautiful newly refurbished Dooneen Pier. There is no slipway at the pier but launching is possible off either of two sets of steps. An easier launching site is at the nearby quay and slipway at Kilcrohane V825-371. The island is best accessed at the NW corner onto steep rocky foreshore. The island is heavily vegetated and quite sheer on all sides and holds little interest for kayakers. A narrow passage separates the island from the mainland. The coastal scenery is quite attractive in the locality. No camping and no water. <strong>Bantry Bay</strong> It is a feature of many of the smaller inner-Bantry Bay islands that surround Whiddy is that landing often isn’t difficult, but further progress inland can be very much so, mostly because of wraparound raised mud cliffs, but also for sheer overgrowth, and often for both. Embarkation The handiest put in point for Whiddy and its satellites is undoubtedly at the slipway V983-482, on the road W out of Bantry town, just by the graveyard.  There is good parking and easy launching at a slipway and gravel beach.  Note in particular that the ferry pier in Bantry 1<em>km</em> E can be very busy, though it does have toilets and water. History of the area A major pilchard fishery flourished until late in the 1700s. It is estimated that over 3,000 were engaged in that industry at its height. Just as when the Donegal herring fishery collapsed suddenly at much the same time, the devastation to the local economy was horrendous.  Unlike pilchards, most other fishing is seasonal, and relatively small time. The major modern historical event in the history of Bantry was the arrival in the bay in 1798 of a French invasion fleet of 15,000 men organised by Wolfe Tone.  However, like a previous French effort a century earlier, this invasion took place in December, which was bad timing. The weather turned into a full blown storm from the NE. Some of the French vessels managed to enter the bay and anchor but the weather deteriorated further. The French cut their anchor cables and headed to sea. Had their invasion succeeded, maybe Corkmen might be speaking French to this day? The redoubt at Reenavanny on Whiddy Island was built 1806/1807 for 100 – 150 men and 8 – 12 guns, to oppose a Napoleonic threat.  That Napoleon’s naval capabilities had been utterly destroyed at Traflgar in 1805 didn’t stop the work.  No gun was ever fired in anger from any Irish Martello tower or battery of this kind built at that time for that purpose. From then on Bantry Bay was the main western base for the British Royal Navy, never more so than during the years leading up to the First World War. During the war it was not unusual to see up to forty British warships at anchor in the Bay. No wonder there are fifty two pubs in Bantry. In September 1918 the US Navy Air Wing established a seaplane base here, at the WSW end of Whiddy Island and it patrolled the area around Fastnet. Five planes were based in Whiddy. The first sinking of a German submarine by an aircraft happened off the mouth of Bantry Bay. With the end of the war the station closed in January 1919. In 1938 the ports of Ireland including Swilly, Cobh, Berehaven and Bantry Bay were handed back to the State. The sight of dozens of warships in the bay ceased and the economy of the towns and villages around the bay spiralled downwards. The Whiddy Island Disaster Whiddy is the site of a large oil terminal constructed in the WSW in 1967 by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Oil\">Gulf Oil</a>.  On Monday, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_8\">January 8</a>, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979\">1979</a> a French oil tanker, the <em>Betelgeuse</em>, was unloading a cargo of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crude_oil\">crude oil</a> at the oil terminal when it exploded. The blast and subsequent fire killed 50 people. The facility was subsequently transferred to the Irish government in 1986 after which it has since been used to hold the Irish strategic oil reserve. During the 1960s, developments in the pattern of oil transportation indicated that it would soon become most economic to move oil between the Middle East and Europe using ultra large crude carrier vessels (ULCCVs). These vessels were so large that they would not be able to enter most of the older ports on the Atlantic Ocean, North Sea or English Channel coasts.  Accordingly, it was judged appropriate to build a new oil terminal in Europe capable of handling the largest vessels that were planned. The intention was that oil coming from the Middle East would be off-loaded at this terminal and then stored for transshipment to European refineries using smaller vessels. The closure of the Suez Canal in 1967 as a result of the Six-Day War reinforced the economic viability of this scheme. Oil shipments had to come round the Cape of Good Hope, thus making redundant the vessel size constraints previously imposed by the canal. In 1966, Gulf Oil identified Whiddy Island as being the most suitable site in Europe for the new terminal, because it offered a long, sheltered deep-water anchorage, well away from any major population centres and shipping lanes. The terminal was operational by 1969. The offshore facility was comprised of an island type berth (known colloquially as “the jetty”) 488m in length, approximately 396m from the shore of the island. The jetty was capable of accommodating vessels of up to 500,000 metric tons of deadweight (DWT), although no such vessels existed at that time. The terminal was very successful for the first five years of operation, but then events began to move against it. The Suez Canal reopened and the economics of ULCCVs began to appear less satisfactory. The late 1970s saw a levelling-off in demand for oil as the result of both economic recession and a rise in the price of oil. All these circumstances caused a fall in the utilisation of the terminal to a level below that which had been planned for. Thus, by the late 1970s, Gulf Oil was struggling to maintain the viability of the terminal. The company had been forced to undertake a number of cost saving measures. Late on 6 January 1979, the <em>Betelgeuse</em> commenced discharging its 114,000 tonnes of crude oil, which was expected to take about 36 hours. Early on Monday, 8 January, a rumbling or cracking noise was heard from the vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing the <em>Betelgeuse</em> engulfed in a ball of fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000 °C. The concrete jetty crumbled and firefighters were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives. The <em>Betelgeuse</em> sank at her moorings in 30m of water, which largely extinguished the main body of the fire. In spite of this, rescue workers were not able to approach the wreck (some of which was still above water) for two weeks due to clouds of toxic and inflammable gas surrounding it. After two weeks, it was possible to start recovering bodies from the wreck and pumping off the remains of the oil cargo that was still on board. The Irish government appointed a tribunal to investigate the incident, which took a year to hear evidence and prepare a 480 page report. That seemed extravagant at the time, but more recent Irish legal experiences make it seem a model of efficiency.  The report indicated three main factors that had contributed to the incident:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The poor condition of the <em>Betelgeuse</em> which had been worked hard and was at the end of its service life,</li>\n<li>Incorrect unloading sequences and ballasting, and</li>\n<li>Inadequate and poorly maintained fire fighting and rescue systems both on the vessel and on the jetty.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All the crew on board the ship at the time of the incident (41 in total) are believed to have died, although not all the bodies were found. In addition, one visitor to the ship (an officer’s wife) and eight terminal workers were killed. During the salvage operation, the life of a diver was lost. In 1986, Gulf surrendered its lease on the site to the Irish government.  The government used the terminal to hold its strategic oil reserve. Initially, oil movement to and from the terminal was carried out by road. In 1990, at the time of the first Gulf War, an improvised repair was carried out to the jetty to allow an oil tanker to offload at the terminal on a one-off basis. In 1996 an unloading buoy was installed and this has been used since that time. A memorial sculpture, incorporating the ship’s bell which was recovered from the wreck, has been erected in the hillside graveyard close by the embarkation point, overlooking the harbour. The bodies of two unidentified casualties from the incident are interred nearby.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Whiddy Island</strong> V969-495          Sheet 85 Step back in time when you land.  Whiddy exists in 1920s style, except for the oil storage facility in the WSW end.  With the otherwise exception of a lovely pub (with tennis court) the Bank House at the ferry quayside, the roads and fields are straight from a period film.  There is only one really nice swimming place, on a beach to the NE at V968-507, but no road goes there.  The scale of the mussel fishing on the E side has to be seen to be believed.  There seems to be a couple of batteries and forts, redoubts even, also up the NE, but any access seems private.  Even the public roads have occasional gates, presumably for convenience driving cattle.  There is the impression that if one got to know its ways, Whiddy would open up to the tourist, but all in all the day-tripper isn’t accommodated the way he might be used to on similar sized islands elsewhere. A bicycle is a worthwhile asset exploring the island on a day-trip.  All the roads are cul-de-sacs so walking would be wearisome eventually.  The oil storage is a “must see” with more than a dozen big containers housing the nation’s strategic oil reserves, that constantly vent and groan.  The big ships don’t come ashore anymore, so the jetty 300m off the WSW point is redundant and looks like a scene from a post apocalypse movie.  The S shore is prettiest, especially around the Kilmore Lakes.  Goats. The island is about 6<em>km</em> long and 2.5<em>km</em> wide. As late as 1880 it had a resident population of around 450, mainly engaged in fishing and small-scale farming. It currently has a permanent resident population of around 20 people, although there are many visitors in the tourist season. The island is linked to the mainland by the Ocean Star ferry, which runs return trips several times a day, and in summer, cruises around the island are also available. Landing Thre main landing spot is at the ferry quayside at Trawnahaha V969-495, on beaches either side.  In 2008 there was an artificial beach on the E side, courtesy of Conoco Oil, where a new slipway was put in to take the car ferry that services the oil storage facility.  Chance the mussels or chowder at the Bank House, splendid each. Circumnavigation Tides flow strongly between the island and Bantry.  Going clockwaise probably utilises the prevailing conditions best.  Much of the exploring en-route will be on the off shore satellites.  Going ashore is possible pretty much at will except for some parts of the long NW facing side.  Cusroe V966-485 is a nice sheltered spit.  There is a slip at V945-488 opposite the industrial scale pier V943-487, below a quick launch building similar to an RNLI station, only bigger, that probably houses an emergency fire fighting ship.  The jetty at V942-494 is to be looked at but kept away from, for fear it would fall on you.  The oil demesne extends over a third the way up the outward shore, and the first realistic stop might be at the stony cove V957-499 or V962-505.  However these coves, like any W facing cove hereabouts, catch the oil spillages, and are dirty underfoot.  Much nicer is the clean NE facing gravel beach at V968-507.  Rounding the corner brings the mariner into surely the greatest raft of mussel farms in the country.  These appear at first to be an obstacle but it is heartening to see the local yachts sail at breakneck speed through the gaps and channels between them.  Altogether the expedition is about 14<em>km</em>.</p>\n",

Two horses grazed in 2008.  Very pleasant. The bigger E half  is inaccessible.  A pedestrian access was forced at one time at the narrow prow leading from the dip, but it has eroded so much that it is now dangerous.  Consequently, the interior has gone back to the wild, and holds no apparent interest for the recreational user. Land easily either side of the dip onto gravely beaches.  No water found. <strong>Glengarriff Harbour</strong> A pleasant, sheltered spot for an excursion on a short or windy day. It is interesting to dodge in and out among the smaller rocks and islands of the bay, trying not to disturb seals and other wildlife, admiring the posh houses and boats, goats, and generally luxuriant landscape. Some of the islets are individually mentioned. Note the warnings on visiting Garinish. Do not disturb the seals. Local boats bring tourists to view the seals so any messing about is less than appreciated. The local boats can phut-phut up to within a few feet of the seals and be ignored. Familiarity breeds contempt. Kayaks, being unfamiliar, are held in high esteem by the seals, who panic on sight. Otter are reported, and terns. Camping is neither appropriate nor welcomed, nor was it found. Embarkation Probably easiest from a sheltered pier and slip about 1<em>km</em> S of Glengarriff where the Castletown Bearhaven road meets the sea at a spot called locally ‘Ellen’s Rock’ at V925-552. Smaller ferries than those from Glengarriff ply from here, and the landing spot on Garinish can be seen 1<em>km</em> to the E.</p>\n",

Her son Roland continued the work and bequeathed the island to the Irish people, so that it is State since about 1950. The gardens are open in summer from about 11.00 to 5.30. There is a Martello Tower on the summit almost obscured by the trees of the plantation, a leftover from an earlier era. Unusually, its sides are vertical. It boasts of being the first such tower on the Irish coast, which, if so, was by a whisker. Superb to visit by kayak or ferry. Expect a race at the SW tip, where the sea is shallow. Landing To avoid serious upset, land only at the official landing point, midway on the N side, in a shallow cove. There is a stony beach at LW, and otherwise a slip. There is also a pier, a cafe, and a turnstile through which pay to enter. There is a boathouse in a cut in the NE side and a slip nearby at V936-550, servicing the restricted (private residence) part of the island. There are shingle beaches either side of the Yellow Rocks off the S side.</p>\n",

It has two formal landings in the SW and NW corners. Both have small pier and steps, but there is also a small stony beach just S of the NW pier, for which kayaks will make. The SW landing is closer to the mainland and would appear to be the more frequently used. Notices are placed at both landings that landing should only be made with permission, so ask locally. The island has a holiday home on its E side which is well screened from view by well planned and maintained gardens and groves of pines. The island has been tastefully planned and laid out with walkways, shrubs, trees and heathers. There is even an irrigation system, fed by gravity tanks centred on the highest part of the island. It appears that the system is linked into the mainland mains-water scheme. The island and the small quay on the adjacent mainland at V896-504 give good shelter for those on passage, or a useful lunch spot for touring inner Bantry Bay.  The quay itself is a well known beauty spot to which many make of a sunny afternoon, signposted Zetland Pier, a lovely place.

Views all round are superb because of the island’s position. It is well worth the visit. Embarkation Set out from a very private little pier with a gravel beach beside, 2<em>km</em> to the N at V793-477.  The pier is itself a lovely place.  It is poorly signposted off the main road and care is needed, to avoid frustrating to-ing and fro-ing.  The road from the N is a cul-de-sac, despite Sheet 84. Landing The traditional landing is onto a pier with steps on its N flank, which can be difficult for kayakers in that the steps are narrow and very prone to Atlantic swell. In calm conditions a landing is also possible onto rock shelves either side of the main pier, but at about HW, it is probably best into a narrow cut just NE. Here a narrow gap allows access into a small pool and a relatively easy landing. Lighthouse Complex The exposure of the lighthouse compound to the elements becomes apparent almost immediately as one takes in the height of the protective wall running along the S and SW flank. Within the SW orientated enclosure, there is the feel of a walled garden, there are stands of Tree Mallow and other marine plants, and remnants of some old gardens can be seen.   A walkway leads to the helipad and beyond that the SW wall. Fauna The island has a good breeding population of gulls, while small numbers of Curlew, Oystercatcher, Turnstone and Common Seal can be found during the winter months. Camping Camping is possible in the main enclosure, although perhaps not in the breeding season – March through July, as this is the main area.  No water found. Film Roancarrig More and Beg are included in the film set for the Neal Jordan’s latest  spectacular film “<em>Ondine</em>”, about a mermaid who falls in love with Colin Farrell, filmed in late summer 2008.</p>\n",

It lies 0.5<em>km</em> NNW of Roancarrigmore and, as of July 2008, was dominated by the remains of a wreck, which, when viewed from a distance, gives this otherwise flat rock an interesting perspective. Ghost Ship Stranger than any Neal Jordan film about any mermaid on a rock is the true story of the 27 year old Spanish fishing vessel <em>Nuestra Senora de Gardotza</em>, the wreck that now deteriorates year by year on this rock.  Having died in heavy seas on 30<sup>th</sup> January 1990, the wreck was at first nothing more than an eyesore, until it became famous 10 years later in December 2000. Another Spanish fishing vessel, called the <em>Zorro Zaurre</em>, got into difficulties after the vessel sprang a leak with 13 crew on board, 140 miles S of Mizen Head on November 30<sup>th</sup> 2000. All the crew were airlifted by the RAF to Cornwall. The crew described the ship as being swamped and said they believed it was within an hour of going under. The vessel was abandoned to sink. It didn’t, at least not immediately. Over a week later, on December 8<sup>th</sup> the Irish naval ship <em>L.E. Orla</em> was asked to follow up a report that a slight diesel slick and fish boxes had been seen in Bantry Bay, to the E of Castletownbere. A Naval Service diving team identified the sunken wreck as the <em>Zorro Zaurre</em>, which which had ended up underwater, a mere 400 metres from the <em>Nuestra Senora de Gardotza</em>. Imagine the shock when it transpired the two were sister ships, same owner, same manufacturer, same hometown in Spain a thousand miles away.  The <em>Zorro Zaurre</em> had travelled 160 unguided and unplanned miles, barely floating and in her death throes, to lie forever in a foreign land immediately beside her sister the <em>Nuestra Senora de Gardotza</em>. Neal Jordan – follow that ! Landing Land fairly dependably in the NE onto a sheltered stony beach in a lagoon. This is accessed through an obvious break in the shoals but this may not be possible if swell is running high. Timing of a landing into this lagoon is probably best at or about HW. The lagoon is a pleasant surprise, and on a good day, a great place for a swim<strong>.</strong></p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Bear Island – <em>An tOileán Mór</em></strong> V686-446          Sheet 84 17.2 sq.<em>km</em>. Bear Haven, a natural harbour of naval importance for centuries, separates this massive island from the mainland. The permanent population is about 200. The distinctly mountainous W end of the island, opposite Castletown Bearhaven, is the most convenient to reach. There are many ‘Private’ signs about the W end, but the Beara Way gives access to the interior. Walking on the high ground is lovely, along little-used waymarked trails and the scenery is wonderful. Ardnakinna Lighthouse at V672-423, marking the W entrance to Bear Haven, is very recent, lit in 1965. The only village is towards the E end at Rerrin, where the island is narrowest. The many guns and fortifications on the island were mostly built as recently as 1910, and some held IRA prisoners during the War of Independence. There are two Martello Towers where there were once four, two having being knocked down for later military building works. The island and its fortifications were held by the British, even after Irish independence, until 1938. They were handed over to the Irish , with other so called ‘Treaty Ports’, Swilly, Cobh and Bantry Bay, after a trade war. This was soon much regretted, when Britain went to immediate and terrible war with Germany. Two 6 inch guns can still be seen at Lonehort Fort, the biggest fort on the island. Two ferries ply between the mainland and the island. The western ferry is from downtown Castletown Bearhaven. The eastern ferry is from Beal Lough at V717-463, 3<em>km</em> E of the town. Embarkation and Landing The harbour of the major fishing town of Castletown Bearhaven is the logical embarkation place. Launch at the slipway at V680-461. The western ferry sets out from here. The pier is one of Nimmo’s.  The slip is just opposite the SuperValu supermarket, which is seriously well stocked. Good parking. The grid reference marks the nearest ferry landing point in a small sheltered bay inside the W end, where kayaks may also land. Tides Bear Haven is a natural harbour varying from narrow and mountainous at its western entrance, to low and shallow at its eastern end. Tides flow in and out at both ends simultaneously, meeting in the middle. The stronger tides flow at 2kn through the western entrance and turbulence may be expected. Tides are not strong otherwise in the sound. At the eastern entrance, they reach 0.5kn.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"346\"><strong>Entrances to Bere Haven</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"94\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">5:50 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"94\">2kn (west)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">0:25 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"94\">2kn (west)</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Tides enter and leave much as with local HW and LW. Circumnavigation There are many interesting spots in the 21<em>km</em> around the island, some of which are listed here, clockwise from the W end. V674-433        Just inside the narrowest point of the western entrance to Bear Haven, it is reachable by backpacking or paddling. The landing is onto sheltered steps, easily identified inside a large yellow buoy and below a zigzag track. A seriously idyllic camping spot, midge free. Shore fishing. Water nearby. V677-440        Gun forts (private) at Fort Point, and also just S at V677-435. V696-447        There are a number of choices for more private camping away from ferries, but for those constrained to use the inside channel, perhaps the nicest would be about 1<em>km</em> E of the western ferry arrival point. Keep away from either ferry as the water is churned up and the swimming unattractive. V741-443        There is a handy stony beach at a slip just inside Rerrin Bay, on the E side. Rerrin is in the E and the only village on the island. Hereabouts the island is waisted which is most convenient to inspect the conditions outside. The village has restaurants, pubs and other facilities. The eastern ferry leaves from Beal Lough at V717-463 about 3<em>km</em> E of Castletown Bearhaven. The eastern end of the island is by far the prettier, welcoming, and more civilised. V748-447        E of the eastern ferry is low lying, but there is a super campsite in the shallow bay near two houses, and also elsewhere E of there towards Lonehort Point. V755-443        Lonehort Harbour lies SW of Lonehort Point. Though storm beaches separate the two, the harbour is the more dependable resting point on a circumnavigation. A bump may be expected at several points along the outside, including Leahern’s Point. V755-435        Leahern’s Point, sheltering Lonehort harbour. V739-434        Storm beach at Coosavaud (means ‘Boat Harbour’), E facing, by a slipway. V721-427        Splendid little cove with a very narrow, S facing entrance, just NE of prominent Greenane Rock, gives great respite. It is better than the nearby and more obvious SW facing cove below houses at V724-428. V672-423        There is no respite from the above cove until the lighthouse at Ardnakinna Point, but watch for the waterfall at about V712-424, and there are others. V671-424        Illaundoonagaul, almost an island, has sea arches of the finest variety, which, being inside the entrance, are very inspectable.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Dursey Island</strong> V506-414          Sheet 84 Huge but sparsely populated island (permanent population of 9) of Great Blasket proportions. It is connected to the mainland by cable car at Dursey Sound. This is the only cable car in Ireland and the only cable car in Europe that crosses salt water. The Beara Way runs the length of the island – along the main roadway outwards and over the hilltops back. It goes past the signal tower on the summit, and makes for a splendid day’s walk. The main area of habitation is about one third along the island but there is no village as such. There is no beach. Embarkation In calm conditions, launching is practical (if a bit awkward) at Dursey Sound, from the pier at V507-418. Certainly, no exploration of the outer parts of the island or the off-lying rocks would be sensible if conditions made launching impossible here. More dependably, there is a magnificent, sheltered strand at the pier and slip at White Strand Quay, in the extreme SW of Allihies Bay, at V523-428. Landing and Camping The pier and steep slip at V506-414 are well sheltered, just outside the S entrance to the sound. No water was found nearby but there must be. Camping is possible just SW of the slipway towards an old churchyard. There is no easy landing other than at the slipway. Rock pools just S of the slipway, which form and un-form with the tide, may provide a landing. Historic O’Sullivan Bere ruled here until 1601. When gaelic Ireland and its Spanish allies were defeated in the Battle of Kinsale 1601, he famously marched with 1,000 soldiers to Leitrim, to join the remnants of the rebellion, rather than give in. They set out on New Year’s Eve 1601. The hardship endured over 20 days and the courage of the men, live on in folklore to this day. Only a few dozen made it all the way to join O’Rourke of Breffni and Red Hugh O’Donnell of Donegal. It was all in vain, and the rebellion fizzled out in 1607, with the Flight of the Earls. The English destroyed his Dursey castle in 1602 in his absence. He might never have been so well known to posterity but that the great scholar and historian Don Philip O’Sullivan, his nephew and great admirer, was a Dursey man, born in 1590. Don Philip recorded the great feats of his defeated uncle, in Latin. His best known work was <em>Ireland under Elizabeth</em> published in Lisbon 1621. Tides The 14km circumnavigation is a challenging experience and races may be expected off the twin outermost points and elsewhere as tides and wind dictate. Tides flow up to 4kn in Dursey Sound and constantly boil, especially over a rock in mid-channel, under the cable-car wires. There is usually clapotis at the northeastern corner of the sound, which kayakers have found to extend 1.5km to Garinish Point to the northeast. Beware flukey winds at the northern entrance. The flood eddies on both sides of the southern entrance. Off the outer tip of Dursey lie the Calf, the Heifer, the Cow and the Bull, mighty, remote and challenging rocks. Until recently, no kayaks had landed. The Bull has a huge lighthouse complex. The Cow has nothing. The Calf has an abandoned stump of a lighthouse. Off these, the main tidal streams around Ireland split. One stream heads south through Dursey Sound and on to Cork, Wexford and Dublin. The other heads north to Kerry, Mayo, Donegal and Antrim. The two streams meet again at Carlingford, the Isle of Man and the England/Scotland border.</p>\n<table width=\"412\">\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"119\"><strong>Dursey Island</strong></td>\n\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"132\"><strong>Dursey Sound</strong></td>\n\n<td rowspan=\"2\" width=\"161\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"119\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"76\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"119\">E (flood)</td>\n\n<td width=\"76\">S</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4kn</td>\n\n<td width=\"161\">5:00 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"119\">W (ebb)</td>\n\n<td width=\"76\">N</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4kn</td>\n\n<td width=\"161\">1:30 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>On the flood, there is extensive eddying in the bay between the southern entrance to Dursey Sound and Crow Head to the south.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>The Bull Rock</strong> V406-402          Sheet 84 The Bull lies 4<em>km</em> WNW of Dursey Head, the headland at the outer tip of Dursey Island, itself 6<em>km</em> in length. This remote rock appears from Dursey direction as a mighty pyramid with a lighthouse complex on top. A landing on it by kayak is one of the top dozen or so obvious Irish challenges. A huge tunnel running E/W splits the Bull. The sides of the tunnel are even and smooth as glass. Navigation of the tunnel is undemanding.  A landing may be forced on the S side of the W entrance, though it leads nowhere. A number of offlying rocks, Gull Rock being the main one 100<em>m</em> W, form pleasant channels outside the W entrance, with wonderful scenery all round. The Bull is a significant breeding Gannetry, bigger than Saltee, second only to Little Skellig. Landing Landing is difficult. There is the standard platform with steps on the S side, at the foot of prominent steps leading vertically up to the lighthouse. However, at LW, the bottom step is a bit high off the water, and rock ledges on either side are subject to much movement of surge and scend. Unless very calm, the platform is wet, and boats should be tethered higher up, where there is generous space. Worst of all though, the spot is vulnerable to a strong sideways current, being entirely exposed. Any mistake will be severely punished. The SE corner of the rock is but a few seconds away, after which a swimmer will be in a full-blooded tide race. There is a severe landing spot on the S side of the E entrance to the tunnel, just tucked inside the SE corner. This is a gloomy spot, and there is nowhere easy to park a boat once off the water. Conditions on the day may demand this landing be used, if subject less water movement. The vertical band of 18 or so brass rungs up the sheer wall looks very off-putting, but in fact, there is a platform at the top with a path leading up to the lighthouse complex. Another set of vertical brass rungs set into the NE face, formerly reported as leading to a set of steps where one could continue towards the buildings, have in 2011 been cut away. Access can be gained to the area by shimmying up a grass ramp and climbing up the retaining wall on which the buildings are built. The manoeuvre is for people with climbing experience and a steady head, as one is forced out close to the drop over the tunnel. The only paddler known to have managed this move made it a tad safer by carrying a towrope by which she protected herself.  Kayakers landing on these “big rocks” are mostly cross-pollinated climbers, know they are taking risks, and most will consider taking a few slings and a bit of rope with them.   Tides Tides flow strongly past Dursey Head. On the ebb, a distinct line of smooth/rough water stretches unbroken all the way to the Calf, with the run off extending well out towards the Cow. Lea Rock lies just a cable or so off Dursey Head and considerable turbulence may be expected here. The ebb seems to run from the Head towards the Cow, or a bit north. The flood is the reverse. The flows are very strong off the corners of the outer islands.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Between Dursey Head and The Bull</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">S</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">3:50 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">N</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">2:35 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Embarkation Launch from Dursey Sound or White Strand Quay, as described previously in the Dursey Island section.

        "description": "<p><strong>The Cow</strong> V425-397        Sheet 84 The 66<em>m</em> high Cow, lying halfway between Dursey Head and the Bull, is an inhospitable place. Sheer walls surround it. Landing by kayak has always seemed impossible for all practical purposes and was never attempted, though some did look, until achieved in 2011.  Lesser Black-backed Gull abound. A mighty sea arch lies off its SE side, and the passage through is challenging. All along the S side lies a thin offshore rock called Gull Rock, which provides shelter for a rest on passage. A difficult landing was forced on the N side of the NE tip.  Securing the boats was awkward.  The climb above is manageable.  Remember to mark your route up and in particular the point where cliff meets flat top, as getting this wrong on the way back down could make things tricky. <strong>Irish Seak Kayaking in the 1980s</strong> Canoeing in general and sea kayaking in particular was in existence in the 1970s and even before that. On 4<sup>th</sup> January 1977 the ICU acknowledged sea kayaking as a distinct discipline within the sport of canoeing, and they hosted the first ever dedicated sea kayaking weekend course that May, led by Colin Mortlock of Nordkapp fame.  The Irish Sea was crossed that July by Joe Halpin, Pat Blount and Aidan Kelly.  Ireland was “rounded” the following summer by Franco Ferrero et al, then “solo” in 1979 by Tom Daly.   Nevertheless it was only with the new decade that the first semblance of a sport emerged with sufficient numbers that people started getting together to do their thing, however informally.  The Nordkapp was “the” boat, and hard times generated many locally constructed clones. The legends are endless but they weren’t all hard as nails, poorly equipped or untrained, but it is true that they couldn’t read the rulebook until after they had first written it, and the gear was nowhere near as posh as it is today.   North Mon and UCC in Cork fed the first viable stream of paddlers into the system.  Tiglin first, but later other outdoor centres, led the way.  “Fleets” of kayaks started appearing. Formal instruction for the masses accelerated at the end of the decade with Stephen Hannon and Humphrey Murphy.  A glance at “First Known Kayak Landings” shows they were getting out to and landing many remote rocky places like Tuskar, Fastnet and the Hull.  Some of them are still at it.  Timmy Flavin et all landed and summited the Cow in 2012, a First Known Kayak Landing.   Jamie Young et al rounded Cape Horn in 1989.  Karen Weekes and Suzanne Kennedy rounded Ireland in 1990, unsupported.  1989 saw Ireland’s first symposium, camping on Clare Island, organised by word of mouth.  Everyone was amazed when so many turned up because noone knew there were 17 boats in the country.  Symposiums became regular annual events after that and Ursula McPherson kickstarted the Irish Sea Kayaking Association at one in Gartan in 1991.  The rest is history.    </p>\n",

This prime piece of property was once owned by Her Majesty Queen Victoria. There is a red iron pillar on the Calf, the stub of a lighthouse destroyed in 1881. A very difficult landing has been forced on the N side. Securing the boats is awkward.  The effort is justified.  Marvel at the many sets of steps cut into the rock.  Enter and climb (with difficulty) the stub of the lighthouse.  Note the sheds/workshops fully roofed and set into natural breaks in the rock ridges. This must be the finest example of using natural contours and gaps to avoid exposure to wave action and blending in to the point of having the structures almost invisible.  Spending an overnight here will stay in the memory for all the right reasons. The Heifer has also been landed on. Two paddlers swam ashore (with difficulty) while a third stood-by with the boats. <strong>Allihies Bay</strong> A truly beautiful place. Stony mountains of remote and rugged appearance back the bay. The village has little more than basic facilities. The main strand and pier at V573-443 below the town is backed by grass, and has a paying campsite. There is a magnificent, sheltered strand at the pier and slip at White Strand Quay in the extreme SW of the bay, at V523-428, where campervans are discouraged.</p>\n",

All landings are onto rock shelves. Four of the larger islands are further offshore than the more numerous inshore clusters. The central rocky spines of all four offshore islands run NE/SW, and all support dense colonies of lichens. The most W island, from which the group gets their name, has a large rock pool midway down the island, into which one can kayak at HW. The narrow cut which divides the two central islands of  this outer group, is just about navigable, but probably only so at HW.  It is barely the width a kayak, and one can easily access both islands by stepping across the gap. Camping Camping is just about possible on the most SE island of the larger offshore group. Two of the larger inshore group also have limited camping.  Lovely setting, no water.  The scenery, backdrop and geology of the area combine to make the area most interesting.</p>\n",

The S side is a series of slanted rock slabs. Landing at the base of these slabs is from deep water. Easy access to the summit is available via a ramp from the SW corner, but landing at this point is very subject to surge and scend.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishfarnard</strong> V600-527          Sheet 84 Splendid big lump of a formerly inhabited island, with a fish farm off its SE side. The whole island is attractive to visit, with a distinct ridge, sheep, and abandoned houses and fields. There are many nice cliffs on the N side. The cave/arch in the small bay at V599-526 is worth a visit especially in good evening light, as sunshine lights up the WNW orientated entrance. The entrance arch at HW is a lovely feature, but a committing passage, being very prone to swell. It leads into a long narrow cavern, which then opens into a blow hole.  There is just about enough room to turn a kayak at HW.  This feature when viewed from above seems nearly to bisect the SW facing tip of Inishfarnard from the main body of the island, – “Inishfarnard Beg” in the making ? Landing and Camping</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The main landing for boats is not so convenient for kayaks, as it is a deep-water landing. It is in a cove inside the fish farm on the SE side, at V609-529.</li>\n<li>Better altogether for kayaks is onto a choice of storm beaches, the best of which is at V600-527, in a WSW facing cut on the N side, looking onto Bridaun. There is splendid camping 100m from the beach. Good fishing hereabouts also.</li>\n<li>Landing is possible at various tide levels on the ENE facing side of the waist at V602-526. This is however less convenient, as large blocks make life awkward, though not at HW.</li>\n<li>Another recommended spot for landing is near the E end of the N side in a NW facing cut, onto a storm beach at V607-531, where excellent camping is available after a small scramble.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Water There must have been a good supply of water at one time. The population was once 24. A search for water on Inishfarnard found quite a bit of seepage water accumulating at the cliff edge directly S of the second most W ruined house. Certainly there is enough for determined campers prepared to dig out a pool. A newly constructed altar, at least that is what its purpose seems, is now in place amongst the houses in the W village. It is small and discrete. It may be Islamic.   It may be linked to a ceremonial plaque outlining the family history of some of the previous islanders and their links to faraway Butte, Montana. The plaque is fixed to large boulder close to most E houses on way up from main landing. Shags, Raven, Chough and Snipe all breed.</p>\n",

Launch at Coornagillagh Quay V801649 or at LW by a causeway at SE corner.  The island consists of two small hills with large meadows edged with furze. Rocky foreshore on N/W sides, but less so on S edge. Small boulder clay cliffs at NW and SW corners add interest for the walker.   The more W meadow is much wetter underfoot and contains a mixture of wild semi-natural areas of marsh, blackthorn and gorse. Landings are possible around much of the island but probably the most attractive area is at mid S side under the ruined farmhouse, where also camping is best. Two ruins exist.  One is in the waisted area in the middle, and is shown on 0S map.  It is set in an attractive copse of silver birch, and was once a fine two storied farmhouse. The second marks a landing spot at the E end.  The island is grazed and although no spring was found, a piped water supply exists at gate at SE corner. <strong>Kenmare River Islands</strong> The Dunkerron Islands and the Greenane Islands are a double group situated about 6<em>km</em> W of the lovely Kenmare, on the N side of the main navigational channel up the bay, called the Kenmare River. Both sets of islands are overgrown, almost to the point of impenetrability, and certainly they are largley ungrazed and unmanaged.  That said, the Greenanes are much the more attractive to the passing recreational user for three reasons,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>that the interiors have at least some grass or open spaces, for camping or anything else,</li>\n<li>the foreshores are stonier and definitely the less muddy, and especially at HW,</li>\n<li>the Greenanes have nice narrow creeks and inlets to explore by boat.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In combination, arriving and loitering on the Dunkerrons can cause a heavy penalty escaping again through the extensive glutinous mudflats that appear. Further, the more SW of the Greenanes are the more open and attractive. Embarkation The whole area is best accessed from a lovely stone built pier just off the main Kenmare Sneem road at V858-698, called locally Templenoe Pier, shown on the OS as Assroe or “Eas Rua” in Irish.  This translates as “red waterfall”, the name being apt.  The water in the stream flowing in here is very rusty, flowing down from red sandstone hills.  Oddly, the rock hereabouts is limestone, but the hills above are sandstone  This is a popular pier, always on the go with swimmers, holiday makers, anglers and dinghy sailors.  There are other piers locally, but public access is less viable.  Both island groups are described here anti-clockwise from Templenoe pier.</p>\n",

At HW the island forms an attractive backwater with a sheltered bay on its landward side. The island is probably accessible at LWN and certainly so at LWS from the mainland close to its N side. Landings are easiest along the N shoreline onto gently sloping seaweed and shingle foreshore. The vegetation is composed of rough grasses, bracken and gorse. The island can be explored easily enough in winter but would probably be heavy going during the summer months.  There are a number of old stone walls surrounding a cut at the W end the purpose of which is now long lost as the island has not been grazed in many years. Water was not found and camping is not attractive. The inner bay area held Mallard, Curlew, Greenshank and Redshank in January 2012.

        "description": "<p><strong>Scariff Island</strong> V454-560          Sheet 84 This is a huge, 252m high, exposed, mountainous lump of a truly offshore island; it was once inhabited by monks. There is an old oratory, very high up, roughly in the middle. There are the remains of a more recent inhabitation lower down, all on the SE side. Local lore says that the children of the settlement got measles and died, ending the human colonisation of the island. The undergrowth is mostly quite long, and despite there being no obvious grazing, gorse has not conquered all. Wellingtons are suitable for general exploration of the long grass and ferns of the island, even on the finest days. Reports of good spring water could not be confirmed even though old wells were found. There is the appearance of a path down along sloping ground to a cove midway along the S side of the island, called Lamb’s Cove. There is a wall down to the head of the cove. This may perhaps have been to facilitate fishing. The Farbregagh (literally – imitation man) at the N tip is a huge sea arch. Landing Access is by a relatively sheltered, deep-water landing in a small cove in the NE corner, called Coosaneeve. Here, the monks cut a stairs of splendid steps in the solid rock (as monks did). These are wondrous to behold. They go all the way down to LW, and are hard to see until very close in, so perseverance is recommended. Local information suggests that the water in the cove is calmer on a dropping tide, but the logic for this is obscure. Tides Tides run more strongly in the sound between Scariff and Deenish than they do inside Deenish. On the flood, the tides reunite off the northern tip of Deenish causing turbulence locally.

Monks Monks inhabited the island from at least the 6<sup>th</sup> Century. A monastic settlement thrived here through Europe’s Dark Ages. Inhabitation may be much older, as monks were most practical individuals, well capable of adopting, adapting and improving on the practices of those who went before them. Vikings raided here in 823 but got poor return for their efforts. These monks were true ascetics, and there was nothing to rob. The settlement consists of beehive-type huts, built on the very summit. Actually, they are built on the secondary of two such summits, but only a pedant would say so. Keep clear of the actual summit of the island, which requires climbing. Many have climbed up and been unable to climb back down.  Climbing down is harder than climbing up. The visitor will be left incredulous at the system of roads and pathways accessing the different parts of the island. Those who conceived and built what is to be seen here wouldn’t remove their caps in the presence of those who built the pyramids. Marvel at the pathways and walls, the stone staircases, the dwellings, the churches, the sheer drops everywhere. Some parts of the Skellig are very dangerous, and for the avoidance of doubt, there are no shops, facilities of any kind, or toilets. There is definitively no drinking water, despite some literature saying otherwise. The many wells are disused and unclean. Embarkation For the kayaker, the Skelligs are a major challenge. They are further out from a landing than any other island dealt with in this guide. Further, there is a serious risk that on arrival, conditions will not be suitable to land. Therefore, the trip should only be undertaken in settled weather. Ideally, choose dead calm conditions. In any event, do <em>not</em> choose wind from the E/NE. Alternatively, those fit enough to turn round and go home again without breaking their journey could try. The journey out is about 20<em>km</em> from Portmagee, or about 3 hours for an average, competent group. Therefore, the level of fitness required across the party should not be underestimated. The Skelligs are thought to be, from certain perspectives, the single most committing paddle in Ireland. Three launching options present themselves: 1.Portmagee is the normal departure point. The journey is a bit longer, but the put-in or take-out is always dependable. Launching is a bit awkward, being over weedy flats, but manageable. 2.A return journey in only 5 hours is possible from a small beach called Keel in Saint Finan’s Bay at V390-685. This though, is less dependable, as it surfs. It saves half an hour’s paddle, each way, not inconsiderable if the journey has to be done both ways. 3.Also in Saint Finan’s Bay, and 2<em>km</em> closer again, is Boat Cove at V376-686, reached from the road by a 500m track down to a pier and slipway in a small harbour, known locally as Glen Pier. Ferries go from Glen Pier to Skellig. The problem with launching from anywhere but Portmagee is that, in anything but calm conditions, Saint Finan’s Bay is an inherently hazardous place. There are cliffs for many kilometres either side of the beach and harbour, and the beach is liable to surf. Portmagee offers a calm put-in or take-out at all times, on a main road. Saint Finan’s Bay must therefore be of interest only to those on passage, on holiday in the immediate area, or in exceptionally calm weather. The difference in the journey for those fit enough for the task does not outweigh the logistics involved in finding the right conditions. This applies to going and, particularly, coming back hours later. Breaking the journey There is the possibility of reducing the overall commitment level in terms of non-stop kilometres to be travelled. At V345-679, Puffin Island may be landed on, leaving a 13<em>km</em> journey ‘only’. Puffin may be reached from Portmagee at about 7/8<em>km</em> to the NE, or at 4.5<em>km</em> from Keel to the E. Routing via Puffin has the further advantage that it, then Lemon Rocks, then Little Skellig, then Great Skellig, all form one long straight line. Beware, the line is not dead straight, but is very usable. Also, this route crosses the tidal flow at right angles making navigation simpler.

Landing The landing is on the NE tip of the island, looking across to the Little Skellig. It is a small pier with narrow, steep steps, up which the kayak must awkwardly be carried. These steps areb extremely steep and narrow, but nowadays they do at least have a handrail. Rope work and teamwork may be necessary, especially at LW. The bottom step gets just covered at LWN. So, landing is the more difficult or even impossible around LWS. Arriving while the tour boats are present (1030 to 1500 hrs. approximately) may greatly increase these problems.  They block access to the landing steps when they’re alongside the quay. They are though in and out fairly quickly – collecting/delivering, but even so one might have to wait 20 mins or more to land Two other landings may be possible should conditions dictate, though the universal opinion is that the main quay at the NE is really the only practical landing, except in emergency. There is a sheltered bay in the SW, where a landing may be forced under the new lighthouse at V246-604, onto a steeply shelving ramp, but which goes nowhere. There is a much better landing onto disused steps at V247-607 in a deep bay, called Blue Cove, on the NW side. It seems these steps are usable only at HW, so some planning is required. This does though entail a very long and awkward carry with full kayaks up steep and uneven steps to find anywhere to leave them.  There are carved steps and a disused pathway up onto the main parts of the island. The present condition of the path is unknown. It is reported that Dúchas intend to improve this path to provide some flexibility. In any event, a waystop is fairly dependable here at HW (HW Cobh 0100). Camping Parties day-tripping should leave the mainland early to maximise their day. Overnighting is strongly discouraged in the high season, April – October. The island is under the joint control of Dúchas and the Commissioners of Irish Lights, from whom permission may be sought to overnight. Apply well in advance. Dúchas are refurbishing the Skellig environment generally, as well as excavating archaeologically. There is nowhere for a tent, and no question of a bivouac anywhere but on the NE pier (the landing spot) itself. The whole question of access policy with regard to the island is very fluid, and nothing should be taken for granted. Arrive well equipped and well victualled, just in case. The reaction of the authorities to your arrival may be influenced by how you, your gear, your attitude and your competence come across.  The island is “open” only between about 1000 and 1600. Outside of these hours you won’t be allowed off the quay, even if you’re tolerated there. Lighthouse The lighthouse was commissioned in 1826 and automated in 1987. The light character is 3 white flashes every 10 seconds. SPA Peregrine, Chough, Storm Petrel, Leach’s Petrel. Birds In the darkest hours of night, the Kittiwake finally go quiet in time for the Manx Shearwater to set up their incomparable cacophony, their hysterical shrieking, their blood curdling Aag     aah       <strong><em>mem</em></strong>    non Aag     aah       <strong><em>mem</em></strong>    non Aag     <strong><em>aah</em></strong>      mem    non Aag     <strong><em>aah</em></strong>      mem    non The birds come ashore only for a couple of hours each night during the breeding season. They even spend their winter out in midocean. They call (to use the most neutral term possible) so that their young can identify them and answer back. Where they breed, they breed in huge colonies. To say there are Puffin on the Great Skellig is an understatement. Nowhere else may the tourist see these crazy birds in Halloween masks in such numbers. They can be seen at close quarters and are easily photographed. Much film is wasted until the visitor slowly realises how really close one may get to these wee creatures. There are also large numbers of Kittiwake and many Storm Petrel.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong><em>Oileán Dairbhre</em></strong> V370-730          Sheet 83 Population 700. A large and varied island lying ENE to WSW on the NW tip of the Iveragh Peninsula. Valencia marks the southern tip of the entrance to Dingle Bay. Inside the island is the flat and sheltered Portmagee Channel, joining Knightstown in the NE to Portmagee in the SW.  The piers at Knightstown and nearby Cahirciveen are by Nimmo. Knightstown is the only town on the island. A ferry runs from here to the mainland opposite at Reenard. Portmagee is a town on the mainland to which the island is connected by a bridge. The bridge opens to allow larger vessels through. The outer parts of the island are 9<em>km</em> or so of committing cliffs, by far the most dramatic of which are at the W end at Bray Head at V327-725. There is only one waystop on the outside section, about halfway along. History Footsteps in the rocks belonging to a tiny tetrapod dinosaur were found some years ago and date back to about 360 million years ago.  Overhead the NE entrance is Valentia Radio, one of the main coastal radio stations of Ireland. The first transatlantic cable was laid from here to Trinity Bay in Newfoundland, a process that began in 1855. In 1857, the ‘Agamemnon’ was nearly lost in a great storm when the cable snapped, at the edge of the continental shelf, 560<em>km</em> out to sea. Later, in 1859, the ‘Great Eastern’ completed the whole of the task solo. Adjacent to the radio station is an abandoned slate quarry.  The slate quarry opened in 1816 and its produce was used in the British House of Commons. Tides The tide flooding northeast past the island to fill Dingle Bay enters Portmagee Channel from both ends simultaneously, meeting 2km east of Portmagee.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Portmagee Channel</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:50 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">1:35 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Local HW is about an hour before Cobh. Streams reach 2kn at Portmagee itself and 1.5kn at Knightstown and Fort Point Lighthouse. Circumnavigation A circumnavigation is an obvious challenge, being logistics free, but is quite long at 25<em>km</em> or so. Many interesting stops might be made, and there are committing stretches on the outside. To save effort, these tides should be carefully planned. A suggestion perhaps, presuming ever-present SW winds, is to embark from Portmagee on the last of the ebb. Utilise the slack/early flood up the exposed part of the coast. Then enjoy the full-blooded flood in, to, and past Knightstown, almost home. Bray Head has a watchtower and huge overhanging cliffs, with fragmented rocks lying off the base with channels between them. NNE from here, reflected waves and strong tides, especially at the protruding points, make for an interesting passage. The only waystop on the outside part of the island is onto a storm beach at V358-762, tucked inside Shrone Point in an E-facing cove. This is about halfway between Bray Head and Reenadrolaun Point, at the lowest part of this section of the island. It is reachable by boreen if necessary. There is good camping and water may be had in the nearby river. If the journey is broken on Horse or Long Island, just 8<em>km</em> of paddling will reach this point. Nevertheless, the steepest cliffs and strongest tides are in this section so expect to be challenged to some degree. The cliffs on the E part of the outside are higher, but not as steep, and get a little shelter. Expect a bounce again at Reenadrolaun Point at V384-786, after which the going should ease considerably. There is a good, sheltered beach just inside Fort Point lighthouse at V404-783, with camping in the grounds, for use in distress only. There is also a less convenient slip outside and W of the point, with better camping but a more awkward landing. Really, those looking to camp in isolation hereabouts would be better to go to nearby Beginish. Knightstown is a pretty spot, worth visiting. All the island’s facilities are here – pubs, restaurants, dive schools, lifeboat, ferry, harbour, sailing. The channel back to Portmagee has fine views, but should be avoided at LW or with contrary tides.</p>\n",

There is a prominent watchtower on top. The residential section is entirely on the western side of the island. The views are idyllic, but are perhaps just a tad too near civilisation. Archaeological excavations have revealed early field systems. Also revealed is a reasonably preserved semi-submerged dwelling. This has a ramp leading down to the doorway. The ramp is now sand covered. This construction is unique for its time and is accepted as a Viking settlement. It was probably used as a stopping place during sea voyages between Cork and Limerick. Further digs are planned to reveal an expected burial ground. It is thought-provoking to note that, at the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, there was sand to a depth of seven feet on this side of the island. Erosion, and especially the introduction of rabbits, led to huge loss of sand in about 50 years. This led to the exposure of the Viking settlement. On the southern side, W of the waist, are the remains of an early Church site. Also nearby is a killeen, and a small standing stone with crosses inscribed on both sides. Camping The best camping is on the southern side of the E end. Here the island is waisted and the land is machair-like, backed by little hillocks. These have pleasant beaches both sides, sandy on the N and pebbled on the S.</p>\n",

The island is low lying but contains an attractive mix of grazed fields and areas of gorse and bracken.  There is some salt marsh along its northern edge which together with the inter-tidal sand and mud flats provides good feeding zones for duck and wader species in winter. The island is a roosting site for the estuarine birds using the estuary.  Chough 2, Merlin 1 and Hare 5 were present in January 2015. The island is accessible from the stony beaches which flank the campsite at Mannix Point or from a small narrow lane V452-786 that opens onto the estuary just west of the campsite boundary. The parking here however is limited to a single vehicle and groups should perhaps ask at the campsite if for additional parking. Mannix Point is a good embarkation point for kayakers who may find themselves in the area in heavy weather when more offshore objectives are not achievable. The area allows access to the northern side of Valentia Harbour or Beginish and makes for a good day trip option. Landings can be made along all sides of the island but care should be taken at times of low water as the northern and western sides dry out.  Camping is available along the western side.

        "description": "<p><strong>Reenard Point to Rossbeigh</strong> V434-776 to V645-910, Sheets 83 / 70 / 78 This trip describes the S side of Dingle Bay, from Reenard Point at V434-776, outside Cahersiveen, to Rossbeigh Beach at V645-910, a distance of about 32<em>km</em>. It is a trip of two distinct sections. The first is more remote, with a mountain ridge separating road from sea, with the mountain dropping to the sea in sheer cliff faces. There are two deep inlets on this part, both with sheltered piers. The second section has numerous stopoff places, and where steep earth and rock banks rise to the main road which parallels the shore, high overhead. Reenard Point at V433-776 is the easiest embarkation place for car access, being close to the main road. A summer ferry runs from here to Valencia. There is a superb seafood pub on the pier. Alternatively, the beach at White Strand (NE of Church Island at V436-793) can be used. Admire in passing, the extensive beach on NE Beginish. Rounding Doulus Head at V404-804, next along are Cooncrome (pronounced Coosecrown) Harbour at V444-816 and Coonanna Harbour at V480-842. Both are wide, deep harbours with pier and beach but no other facilities. The onward trip is just as committing with the next landing about 10<em>km</em> away at Kells Bay at V555-880. Kells Bay is a wide, deep inlet, with a sheltered pier – a noted beach and holiday spot. On the way, look for a stream falling clear to the water, where the cliffs form a bottleneck into which you must go to get under the waterfall. Also on the way, you come to Gull Rocks at V520-873, which are really little islands – sheer, high and close to the cliff-lined land. There is a sense of isolation around them. Finish at Rossbeigh (or Rossbehy) beach and sand dunes. This is a noted family beach, in parts like a typical machair, with hotel and holiday village. There is even a small sweet shop and chip shop, open during summer. The council maintain public toilets, water, and rubbish collection. They charged €7 per tent per night in 2002. Pitch where you like, except in the football field or tennis courts. Rossbeigh can have decent surf, and the dunes have been mapped for orienteering events. This area has been and remains <em>the</em> meeting ground for all Irish paddlers and surfers for the Christmas/New Year break. The long sand spit of Rossbeigh Point that extends N from Glenbeigh was breached at its N end by coastal erosion c.2009 leaving a substantial island lying offshore. The island consisted of extensive intertidal sandy beaches and sand dunes covered in Marram grass. Tides flowed strongly off both the N/S ends entering and leaving Glenbeigh and Cromane Harbours. The breach made between the point and the island was considerably eroded since Jan 2011 and the shape of the island was changing from year to year.  The breach is now more or less closed as of January 2013 and Rossbeigh Island as it was known for a few years has been once again subsumed into the mainland. There is ample parking at the S end of Rossbeigh Beach. However, there is a height barrier restriction that will not allow access for vans or campers which will have to park on roadside or at the local pub across the road.  The carry at times of HW is reasonable. Rossbeigh beach surfs frequently so an approach from within Glenbeigh or Cromane Harbours may be considered. <strong>The Dingle Peninsula</strong> <strong><em>Corca Dhuibhne</em></strong> <strong>Coastal Section</strong> <strong>Dingle Town to Slea Head</strong> <em>Baile an Daingin go Ceann Sléibhe</em> Q445-010 to V317-967   Sheet 70 Dingle town is a major fishing and tourist town, at the head of a sheltered bay. Embark at the harbour (the pier is by Nimmo) V441-009 where there is good parking.  Parking and launching are “paying”.  There is also a small car park at V453-997, halfway out the harbour on the E side, more suitable for small groups or  dolphin watching.  ‘Fungie’, the local friendly dolphin, is an experience not to be missed. However, you must also work your way around the many tour boats trying to spot him. Parking is very restricted.  Camping may be possible here or near the old tower. There is a path into town along the shoreline. Only the mouth of Dingle Harbour is narrow, and once inside the bay opens wide.  The beach SE of the mouth dumps, unfortunately. The trip to Slea Head is 16<em>km</em>. Hug the cliff line, and in calm water explore the many arches, caves, coves, and stacks.  This stretch is without landings, unless a detour is made into Ventry Harbour – <em>Cuan Fionntrá,</em> halfway along.

There is a regular ferry to the Great Blasket only. There is little in the way of anchorages for bigger boats at the outliers, which are also rugged and exposed. Therefore, sea kayakers are privileged to have the finest way to explore the group as a whole. The Blaskets are a showpiece of Irish sea kayaking. That said, among the outliers, only Beginish and Inishvickillane have landings that are in any way dependable. Good conditions are needed elsewhere to avoid having to swim ashore, or worse. Expect to have to work for any landing. The commitment of the group should be consistent. The islands are uninhabited. Great Blasket was abandoned in 1954. Earlier in the century, 176 people lived there. There was a community here in 1588 when the Armada was about the place.  Between 1800 and Irish political independence from Great Britain in 1921, there was always about 150, including on Inis Mhicileain into the 20<sup>th</sup> century.  Inis Tuaisceart, Beiginis and Inis Mhicileain (up to 8) were occupied from time to time, and even Inisnabro had 4 in 1851 after the famine. The islands did not thrive with independence.  There was never the money for a pier.  The breakwater erected by charity money on the main island in earlier times never really gave enough shelter, so that except in very fair weather, only very small boats could land.  That meant that the island was cut off for long periods when other such islands would not have been.  Lack of access to mainland schools, hospitals, churches and shops wore the people down.  Then the turf ran out in the 1930s and even keeping warm in winter wasn’t guaranteed. There was always a single house on Inishvickillane. The Great Blasket now only has summer homes and there is one on Inishvickillane. There is an interpretive centre for the islands on the mainland at Dún Chaoin. Embarkation There are several places from which to embark, none of which are easy. Q314-002        Dún Chaoin Pier, from which the ferry operates, is the logical embarkation place, being sheltered. It has good parking, less than private camping, no water, but the pier is reached by a most unpleasant, steep carry. Launching is off a very steep slipway, or to one side in calm conditions. Group co-operation is often necessary. Q312-005        There is a small bouldery beach at the end of the laneway past the interpretive centre, which may be suitable for small groups in settled conditions. Q316-033        Clogher beach has a car park above but can surf with any swell from the W. V313-981        Coumeenoole or Slea Head beach lies almost 1.5<em>km</em> N of Slea Head itself, tucked inside Dunmore Head (V302-980). It gives a shorter trip. It often surfs, yet has merit for embarkation. With N winds, or when calm, it is very much the preferred option. The carry is better than the pier at Dún Chaoin, and the parking is excellent. Tides Tides in the Blasket Sound – <em>An Bealach</em> and elsewhere through the islands, flood north and ebb south, twisting with the channels. An exception is the channel between Inishnabro and Inishvickillane<em>,</em> in which the flow is always west. The tide races in the sounds, including Blasket Sound, have a fierce reputation.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"308\"><strong>Blaskets</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"170\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">N</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">4:30 after Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">2-3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">S</td>\n\n<td width=\"170\">1:50 before Cobh HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1-3kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>Local HW is about an hour before Cobh. The stream timings are affected by strong winds. In particular, in sustained southerlies the flood runs longer and stronger. The speed of the tidal streams in the main channels varies, but is generally 1 – 3kn. In the narrower channels, in springs, the stream can reach up to 4kn, except between Inishnabro and Inishvickillane, where it is always weak. In Blasket Sound, the north-making flood rushes past Dunmore Head <em>– An Dún Mór</em> and eddies clockwise around <em>Dún Chaoin</em> Bay. Outward bound, small boats could do worse than follow the example of the ferry, which follows the coast southwest almost to Dunmore Head before crossing. In wind, this may get your boat above the bumpier parts of the tidal race, for a much smoother passage. On the south-making ebb tide, try a more northerly route, taking shelter from Beginish. Beware of reported local magnetic anomalies.

The Spanish Armada The long awaited Spanish Armada sailed through the English Channel in August 1588, but no really decisive battle was fought. The Spanish knew they couldn’t achieve their main aims, and decided to sail home anti-clockwise around Scotland and Ireland. The English left them to it. The weather and the Atlantic would surely do what they had failed to ? They turned left at Fair Isle and left again near Rockall. Sailing South from so far North very few of the sailors had ever experienced, the great fleet broke up and it was each ship for itself. Some ran for land out of hunger and thirst, some got home, and some tried and failed. It is thought that 26 Spanish Armada ships were wrecked on the Irish coasts in 1588, from the Blaskets in the SW around to Dunluce Head in the NE. The Blaskets is a tale of good and bad fortune. Vice Admiral Recalde knew the tiny gap between Great Blasket and the reefs / islands to the NE. He had seen this coast before in an expedition in 1580 to put Italian soldiers ashore in Smerwick. He went through first on 14.9.1588 in <em>San Juan</em> followed immediately behind by the frightened but trusting Captain Aramburu in the <em>San Juan Bautista.</em> This has long been regarded as an act of truly superb seamanship, proving the failure of the armada was related to many factors including maybe the quality of its ships, but distinctly not the men who sailed them. The two ships swapped anchors, sent men ashore for water, and then they waited. On 21.9.1588, a big storm came up, in the middle of which appeared the <em>Santa Maria de la Rosa</em> from the NE. Her anchor held only as long as the tide was flooding N (the wind was from the N, and helped to hold her), but once the tide changed, the wind and tide had her, so she slipped away, and was lost with all hands in less than 2 hours. Then yet another <em>San Juan Bautista</em> appeared and another small ship. Both were considered spent, were scuttled, and their crews taken aboard the two <em>San Juans</em>. All made it safely back to Spain. A major contributory factor for the number of ships of the armada wrecked off the Irish coast was the loss to most of them of their main anchors off Calais the month before. The English drifted fire-ships down onto the fleet as it lay anchored, a tried and trusted attack offensive strategy of the day, devastating in the right circumstances. The Spanish were ready for this well known ploy, and slipped anchors to dodge them. Standard operating procedure intended they sail a <em>km</em> or so to one side, and then slip back to retrieve their previous anchorage. However, they all got in each other’s way, and the tides were strong. In their clumsy manoeuvring, a lot of them lost ground they couldn’t make back up. Very few made it back to their main anchor again. The English thought the (expensive) ploy had failed badly, but in fact, it accounted for dozens of Spanish ships, only it took time. Embayed off Scotland or Ireland with only reserve anchors, many ships were lost that would otherwise have made it, as with the <em>Santa Maria de la Rosa</em>. There were other factors. The ships themselves were mostly too weak for the rigours they experienced. They just weren’t up to the North Atlantic in late Autumn. Battle damage added to the problem, as did the stress on their timbers from firing huge cannons they were never designed for. There was no easy way to calculate longitude in those days, only dead reckoning really, and sometimes going over a week without a sun fix, many were caught out. The maps of the day were inadequate and the sailors mostly just didn’t know Scotland or Ireland. The new Wagenhaer’s Chart was too small a scale, and the older Ortelius showed western Ireland as a straight line coast. Many a ship at dawn was delighted to spy land, but later found itself embayed. Unable to sail to windward, the end was nigh. Usually they anchored at that point but many were short on anchors. In Scotland if they got ashore they were looked after. Many got safe passage home. Even if the ship returning them had to put into an English port for repairs or for any reason, the English gave them safe passage. The Armada threat was past, and the English were chivalrous. Things were different in Ireland. All of Recalde’s sailors who went ashore for various reasons were put to death. Worse, far worse, would happen elsewhere. Irish peasants had never seen anything as wealthy as the miserable Spanish sailors they came across on beaches and headlands up and down the west coast. Their natural instincts guided their reactions. Typically they stripped the sailors naked and robbed them of everything. Then by all accounts, other peasants were quite hospitable to them, once they were equally miserable looking. The English on the other hand had a game plan. Ireland had a new Governor, Lord Fitzwilliam, just three weeks into the job when the first Armada sailors swam ashore in September 1588. He feared that they would make alliances of convenience with local rebel clansmen. That never happened but he never stopped fearing it might. Typically the sailors were challenged and surrendered. Once in captivity they were rigorously interrogated. The wealthy few whose families might ransom them were saved but the rest were put to death, mostly by hanging.</p>\n",

The main slip/pier is  at V280-977 below the village, difficult to make out until close. The pier is somewhat sheltered, but some surge is always present. Water is from a tap high up at the SE end of the village, convenient to the pier, but a longer walk from the beach White Strand –<em>An Trá Bán</em> at V277-980.  Theisland is a National Park.  Camping is banned and landing even for day trips is barely tolerated.  Certainly it is unwise to land in high season at the main pier, and worse to camp in its vicinity. On a day trip, the <em>An Trá Bán</em> at V277-980 beach is much the easier, near a ramp, and small groups might chance camping above. There is a splendid cafe for daytime snacking. Rock climbing has been opened up on the island, with a cliff just SW of Gurraun Point at V283-977 (the most E point of the island). Splendid walking tracks run high along both sides of the ridge of the island, like a necklace, giving an excellent circuit. On circumnavigation, tides run strongly at the three corners. The lee side of the island is often subject to fierce downblasts of kattabatic wind. Tides run strongly in Black Sound between Inishnabro and Great Blasket, where the wind can be funnelled and strengthened. The narrow gap off the northern tip is subject to sudden unexpected surges or boomers as big sets pass. Through this gap go circumnavigators or venturers to the outlying islands. The passage is between a rock off the main island and a small islet at V272-985, being the innermost in a string of such rocks. In an autumn gale in 1588, one of the largest ships of the escaping Spanish Armada entered Blasket Sound and ran safely through this gap. Thus they performed one of history’s most remarkable pieces of seamanship. Two other Armada ships were wrecked locally. Mice Great Blasket offers mice with long legs and big mouths. Local lore puts this down to the mice arriving with the Vikings 1,100 years ago, in bales of hay, and what with the sides of the island being steep. Others like to think of Darwinian adaptability, the island being relatively inaccessible to their predators. Either way, they do weigh more and have larger hind-feet. Seals Ireland’s second largest haul out of atlantic grey seal occurs here each autumn on <em>An Trá Bán</em>. Several hundred seal come here to pup between September and December. The only bigger colony is on Inishkea North in County Mayo.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishnabro – <em>Inis na Bró</em></strong> V212-925          Sheet 70 Landing Landing is midway on the south-eastern side, in a tiny cove. The entrance to the cove is under a tall narrow arch, into a sheltered pool, open to the sky. The landing is onto boulders, and very much subject to surge and scend, especially in SW winds. The cove runs SW/NE and is unmissable when travelling from the SW, but is hard to see going the other way. The cove is distinctly the tallest along this side, opposite Inishvickillane – <em>Inis Mhicileáin.</em> It is situated just E of the only shallow bay along. Here there are the remains of a stone wall overhead, just visible when close. Scramble up the gully behind. The tall arched entrance is narrow but the pool is wider. Kayakers with laden boats have found this landing very difficult with any swell running. Inishvickillane – <em>Inis Mhicileáin,</em> is more reliable altogether for those in the outer regions of the Blaskets. The island looks like it is covered with heather, but this is actually solid Sea Pink on the S side. There are magnificent cliffs on the N. The island is distinctly saddled when seen from N or S. There is a fantastic array of buttresses on the E end. The cliffs of the N side are huge and impressive. There was always a small community living here and four people are recorded as having lived here in 1851 after the great famine.  Certainly there are the remains of a promontory fort at the W end, a clochan, and evidence of cultivation.  One version is that the island was intensively cultivated with corn, which was even ground on the island.  Another is that Inishnabro was known for its booleying, the summer grazing of cattle from the Great Island.  Booleying certainly was a common practice at the time. Tides A tide race ebbs southeast at the northeastern corner. Tides run strongly in the sound between Inishnabro and Great Blasket and the wind can be funnelled. The flow in the sound between Inishnabro and Inishvickillane always flows weakly westwards, being an eddy of the main flow north/south in either direction. Therefore, there is often a lump in the narrow western end of the sound where tides collide.</p>\n",

On a high plateau lie a holiday home, outhouses, a herd of purebred native Irish Red Deer, and a helipad. The island was owned until June 2006 by a colourful, cultured, popular yet controversial Dublin character. He merited police protection as a retired public figure and valued his privacy. It remains to be seen what access issues will arise in his wake.  The house is designed to fit discreetly into the hillside, and is built of local stone and timber. The whole is an example of how these things might be done right. When the owner is present, presumably mostly in August, kayakers should keep below the HW mark. Below the house lies a cove at the NE corner of the island. Once there was a teleferique system here for uploading material. It is no longer operational, and has been left as an unsightly mess. Landing The landing is on the western end of the N side, opposite Inishnabro, just inside the narrows, onto a sheltered semicircular stony beach. This is the most dependable of all outlying landings. The always W-making current in the channel is weak, so the landing is only out of bounds in the severest of relatively rare easterlies. There is a retractable pontoon-landing device at steps on the point just N of the landing beach. The now disused path up from the beach is getting overgrown since the pontoon was installed at the nearby point, but is still manageable. The island is much talked of in ‘Twenty Years A-Growing’ as a place inhabited by fairies. The outhouse is where O’Sullivan had his rabbits stolen in the dead of night in November 1914 by passing sailors, who left a tin of tobacco in payment. Paddlers may find ‘Mickey the Pillar’ at the western end of the S side at V207-908, and Mickey can also be seen below the ‘Hollow of the Eagles’, the flat stretch of the plateau to the SW. Mickey is a pillar of rock, the top of which looks like a man sitting wearing a wide brimmed hat. Moon Cave is nearby. Circumnavigation is recommended for the spectacular rock scenery. There was a small community always throughout the 19<sup>th</sup> century, of up to eight persons.</p>\n",

It is indeed a small island, NE of the Great Blasket, with a ruined house.  This was last occupied by Richard O’Carroll, a cattle herdsman who tended cattle on the islands, where the grass was good.  The only problem was there was no water.  He shipped in the water in barrels every day, in fair weather or foul.  He only had to be unlucky once and eventually his luck ran out. Viking longships used to hide out in the bay between the island and <em>Oileán na nOg</em> Young’s Island to the NNE, where newly weaned lambs were put to grass. The landing place is onto a relatively sheltered, stony beach on the NW side, but also in shelter in bays on the NE and SE. Significant numbers of tern – Common, Arctic and a few Roseate.</p>\n",

It is a dramatic island with major cliffs on the NW side and a distinct cockscomb shape at NE end. Landing Landing is not easy, being onto a severely sloping slab, with little shelter, on the SE side. A handrail up from the top of the slab is visible when close in. There is a sheep pen on the grass above. From further out there is a large obvious dorsal-fin shaped slab, and the landing is just SW of this. Landings may be forced elsewhere in the lee of the island, but beware of steep scrambles. Unloaded, borrowed, plastic boats are an advantage. The island features a minor monastic ruin at Q234-004, marked St. Brendan’s Oratory, on the only flat section of the island in the SW. In more recent times, it was used as a domestic dwelling. There are fields around it. It is a low-lying, drystone hovel with a smoke hole on top, and a very narrow, low entrance. There is the horrendous story of how Peig and Tomas O’Catahin became stormbound sometime after 1838.  Tomas died and Peig could remove his body, which putrified.  She resorted to hacking bits off it and throwing them out the smoke hole.  When islanders relieved her weeks later, she had become demented, but she later recovered. The island well repays the effort of landing. <strong>Coastal Section –</strong> <strong>Sybil Point to Brandon Point</strong></p>\n",

Nearby Lough Gill is well known as the stronghold in Ireland of the Natterjack Toad. Named for being a frog that “walks” and doesn’t hop, it comes out mostly at night and has a yellow line down its back.  The islands lie on the northern side of the Dingle Peninsula, off Rough Point at the end of the isthmus that divides Brandon Bay from Tralee Bay. The underlying rock is limestone.  Basking Shark and Blue Shark are reputed to be common in these waters in the summer months. The area teems with bird and other wildlife. In Irish, the islands are called <em>Oileáin an Mhachaire</em>. Machair is a coastal feature inside an exposed sandy beach consisting of a raised dune system that has been flattened by grazing. Grazing and wind combine to create and maintain a flat grassy area. There are no raised dunes or the dunes are relatively insignificant to the overall feature. Machair is much loved by birds, (who call it a ‘roost’), by sheep (who call it a ‘meal’), by golfers (who call it a ‘links’), and by tourists (who call it a ‘campsite’). Certainly, its well-drained, short grass is excellent for camping. Once heavily grazed, nowadays its features are orientated more towards leisure pursuits, caravan parks and football pitches. Machairs are most common in the NW of Ireland between about Galway Bay and Malin Head. Embarkation Embarkation is from Scraggane Pier (by Nimmo) at Q613-196 just inside the W point of Scraggane Bay. There is a wide, gradually sloping slipway, with good parking, water, and toilets.  A new slipway to accommodate recreational use has been constructed nearby, and incerased parking has been provided between the two slips. There are also ample paying campsites generally in the area. A pub and shops can be found at Fahamore, 1<em>km</em> to the SW.  The whole Castlegregory peninsula is a thriving mix of varied holiday making.  There are endless campsites, houses, schools for diving, windsurfing and all forms of watersport.  The area has undergone massive development this millennium.  Wild camping is discouraged in high season.

Appearing unapproachable from afar, there are in fact numerous landing opportunities, the ease or difficulty of which varies hugely with tide height and conditions.  More difficult at higher water levels, landings are not impossible at HWS, but certainly very difficult with any swell and probably not worth the effort.  At LW the easiest by far of the landings in onto the beach just NW and under the summit, formed when the gap with the islet Minnaun closes out to make a NW facing horseshoe.  Even at HW when this whole configuration disappears, there is a little cut at the back of the beach onto a narrow stormbeach, just below the summit.

The island is large and quite attractive and has a number of interesting features to explore.  The island is flat and grassy on top and is grazed by sheep periodically.  There are cliffs all around.  A holding pen is located at the E end. There are great views all round both of the island group and the mountains of the Dingle peninsula. There are two fine examples of caves with blow holes on the S side, whose exit points on the island top may catch the unwary walker. The cave foot is a long way down in both examples.  Landings onto their attendant storm beaches were not possible in April 2010 but would merit exploration when conditions allow. There are two sea arches located at the E end of the island. The more N one, just on the sheltered (E facing) side of the NE tip, hosts a storm beach, at a cave, which is really a huge collapsed blowhole.  Many Rock Dove nest in the arch overhead.  A stake with tethered rope for landings (from larger boats) is located here. The more SE one leads into an inner lagoon and cave area that is not accessible at LWS, but may be so at other stages of the tide. It is very picturesque. Landing There is a good landing available on the N side of the SW corner of Illaunimmil where a small NE facing bay forms at times of LWS between the island and an outlying islet – Listooskert  Q602-221.  The landing is onto a storm beach.  The outying islet itself has an attractive layered geology. The passage that separates the islet from Illaunimmil is not navigable at LWS but almost certainly so at other stages of the tide, and the landing is always somewhat protected given reasonable weather conditions. The island summit can be reached by a number of gullies or rock shelves that back the storm beach. The island is grazed by Brent Geese and possibly Barnacle Geese over the winter months.

Fenit lies outside the mouth of where the harbour at Blennerville gives way to Tralee Bay outside.  Launch from the town beach Q727-154 – Sheet 71, just at the beginning of the bridge to the island.  Parking, water and toilets are available at the beach, as is a lovely cafe.  All the usual small town facilities are available in Fenit.  A major local attraction is Fenit Island (local name) or Fenit Within (OSI name), a beautiful walk N of the town, very popular.  The underlying rock is limestone. Samphire Island has been developed beyond all recognition.  Originally a small high rock, it is now joined to the mainland to the N at Fenit village by an 800m bridge.  A modern working fishing and manufacturing facility has been built on the island.  There is also a marina for pleasure yachts, the RNLI station which launches from the marina, the fishing club and much else.  The Sailing Club is on the mainland end of the bridge. Hazard Beware paddling under the bridge.  Tides run strongly.  The worst bit though is that an integral part of the structure of the bridge is a horizontal spar running between all the uprights above LW but at less than HW.  No more dangerous a contraption may be imagined.  At two thirds tide height it works as a classic sieve, a concept feared by kayakers the world over.  Even at other stages of the tide, it is still dangerous, being festooned with nets, fishing hooks, and detritus of all kinds.  Keep away. Approaching the island at road level on foot, one is struck by the statue on the top of the rock.  This is Saint Brendan the Navigator 484 – 578, who features at various points around the coast, but who was a native of Fenit.  He is best known for being the first European to go to and return from America. His parents were in an early wave of newly converted Christians in Ireland and he was ordained as a priest in 512 at age 28.  He became a bishop and was hyperactive in setting up abbies and monasteries in Ireland and abroad.  His missioning was mainly but not exclusively to the N, such as St. Kilda and the Orkneys, but he also worked in Brittany and Normandy.  In his travels he also visited the Faroes, Iceland, and Newfoundland.  Fenit is still proud of its local boy made good. The rock that is the original Samphire Island is a theme park on a small scale, with imitation wedge tombs and beehive huts.  Well worth the visit.  The modern working port area impresses for the scale of what is being manufactured.</p>\n",

Shannon Airport just across the estuary now fills the role of international airport to the west of Ireland, but with modern aircraft able to fly much longer distances, its role isn’t quite as critical. Its very long runway will always deserve it a role as a hub for certain long-haul airflights. Commercial foresters will find Foynes Island interesting, but others won’t be so turned on. It is a lumpy square kilometre of deciduous and coniferous trees. The interior is essentially impenetrable and holds little of interest to passing leisure craft. Land The main landing is at a pontoon at the S tip called Barneen Point, opposite the public harbour in the village. This gives access to the few houses on the island and should be considered private. The entire of the rest of the shoreline is accessible at HW but a sea of mud at lower waters. The mud is fine glutinous silt, most unpleasant. Whether extending a handful of metres or one hundred, landing onto it isn’t an option. Access can be conveniently achieved at only one other spot, halfway along the SW side at R245-523. Here, rocks come down to the water that are both accessible and mud free. Otter and Greenshank. <strong>County</strong> <strong>Clare</strong> <strong>Islands of the Fergus Estuary</strong> The Fergus Estuary is the branch of the Shannon Estuary that juts N up towards Ennis, the county town of Clare. It is choked with islands big and small. The boating hereabouts is similar in some ways to Clew Bay and inner Strangford Lough. The big distinguishing factor here though is that this entire system is the upper reaches of an estuary, whereas the others are simply drowned landscape areas. Mud Accordingly, while Clew Bay to a large extent and Strangford Lough very much so, may be muddy, very muddy, especially in their inner reaches and in their nooks and crannies, every tiny part of this area is affected by mud. The mud is a fine glutinous silt, quite unpleasant. The silt permeates the water everywhere, and swimming isn’t on.  The only parts that suffer less mud are the parts of islands scoured by the main flow, being – logically enough – the E side of the many islands on its W side and the W side of the few islands on its E side. Mudflats As with all such places, vast areas become extensive mudflats at LW, and a heedless moment on a falling tide can carry a heavy penalty. Tides run strongly through the channels, and indeed the tidal range is huge.  Nevertheless, even in Springs, the speed of the lateral flow equates to mere neaps in Strangford, despite that the vertical range is much greater. There is no commercial fishing of any kind done, but there must be flat fish and mullet who love such conditions. Clew Bay and Strangford are each end of Ireland’s drumlin belt, but the islands here have solid limestone bases, not boulders and clay. The land is therefore very rich and fertile. The bigger islands are farmed, mainly cattle and sheep, with some horses and goats. There is no tillage. Nowadays the farmers all live on the mainland nearby. The last full-time island resident (Deer Island) died in August 2004. She was the only female sole inhabitant of an Irish island in the 2002 census, there being three other sole male inhabitants. Farmers hereabouts commute to work on flat bottomed or shallow draft boats, of a kind used in estuaries the world over. They are among the very few Irish farmers that carry tide tables on their persons at all times. Embarkation There is really no convenient embarkation point on the E side at all. There are two only on the W side. Most central is Crovraghan Pier R278-601, a small working pier, busy at commuting times.  This means mid-tide on the up and mid-tide again on the down, when there will be many cars arriving and departing the pier, and left there between times. It is well sheltered by Illaunbeg 100<em>m_offshore, fast deep water filling the channel. A pleasant spot for campervanning.  The slipway being steep, the amount of mud to struggle past at LW is limited. Certainly it is always open at neaps, and possibly springs.  The channel is then always open to N/S.  The flow is very fast.  The pier is reached from a signposted crossroads 2_km</em> N of Killadysert on the main Ennis road. To the S, Cahiracon Pier R248-563 may be the more convenient, depending on the excursion plan, especially for the more S islands, or an excursion S across the Shannon Estuary. It is reached from just S of Killadysert. Any excursion in the Fergus Estuary is best carried out around HW, and Cahiracon may be preferred for allowing a more comprehensive exploration in the one go.  Cahiracon though is however a dumping ground and a ships’ breakers’ yard. Most unpleasant. Tides HW in the estuary is an hour after Galway, slightly ahead of Limerick Docks, which is 1:30 after Galway. The main channel is on the eastern side, but on the top half of the flood, locals prefer a channel that hugs the coast on the western side, inside Illaunbeg and Illaunmore (Deer Island). The ebb and flood occur with the rise and fall of the water. The direction of the flow is basically north/northeast for the flood and south/southwest for the ebb, but it tends to twist and turn with the channels and the results are peculiar on occasion (e.g. in the channel northeast of Crovraghan Pier). The flow can be very fast and strong at times, but never really all that violent, despite the range being enormous by Irish standards, easily over 6m. The islands are given here more or less from the SW.  Inishloe is unapproachable except at HW, difficult to fit in with a planned excursion, so only cursory information is available.</p>\n",

The farmhouse is midway on the S side. Paddling round it is reminiscent of what paddling through Counties Cavan or Monaghan may be like if and when water levels rise sufficiently. The hedgerows may be lusher though. Its steep fields are stocked with cattle and sheep. The point of embarkation dedicated to this island is at Rosscliff to the W at R288-633.  From Ennis take the first left as you enter Ballynacally. The road appears to lead into an estate but follow the rural road to the river.  Rosscliff is a long narrow slip that alows launching at all states of the tide. The channel is always open to the S, but the channel going N after Deer Island dries out. It is possible to make way NE around Deer Island and into a channel. Beware many mud flats and shallows. Parking here is limited as it is a working slip for farmers moving stock in and out to the islands. Deer Island was until 2004 unique among Irish islands for having a sole resident who was female.

On the summit are a trigonometrical station and a more attractive monument. The latter is said to have been erected by the then landowner to his son who was killed in the Boer War at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century, probably fighting for the British. The monument is slightly squways. Local lore has it that in 2004 when President Bushe of the U.S.A. visited Ireland, there was a massive security operation around Shannon Airport, about 4<em>km</em> away. Irish soldiers making security checks interfered with it, in case it was hollow or the like, but didn’t do a good job putting it back together. Pity. The main landing spot is a jetty and slip at the W side. The slip reaches out as far as all but the lowest LWS. There are several houses all now boarded up. Farmers commute here by day on the tide from Crovraghan Pier. Cattle, sheep and horses are stocked. There are two old churches, both at the SE, and one graveyard is still in limited use. A network of boreens criss-cross the island. From the summit, the very best views of the estuary hereabouts are achieved, up to Ennis, down to Aughinish aluminium plant on the limerick side, and of course Shannon Airport to the E, planes taking off every few minutes.

It has a long and varied history and its origins are mostly associated with St. Senan, born in 488 A.D. He founded the Christian settlement there in the 6<sup>th</sup> Century. It was a holy island until the Vikings took over for a century or so before being recaptured by Brian Boru in 975. The Vikings must have been pleasantly surprised when they first arrived, to find the access door to the round tower at ground level. This makes it the most easily accessible round tower in Ireland. The island was inhabited until 1978. No artificial fertiliser was ever used on these fields so the island is of ecological interest as a semi-wild grassland. The south, west and north of the island away from the main buildings is wild and rugged but has good wildlife interest especially at the lagoon areas near the lighthouse and at the north end. Widgeon, Teal, Curlew, and Redshank were seen in good numbers in January 2012. 1 Hen Harrier was at the small pond in the centre of the island. There is an abandoned village on the northern end of the E side. Many of the cottages have fallen into disrepair and access is now denied with security fencing in place. The lighthouse and battery are at the southern point. The battery is in good condition but access to the roof through the hole in the ceiling is now impossible. Metal grids prevent entry to the inside of the battery. The lighthouse was first established in 1872. The old lighthouse cottage is in poor condition but there is evidence of some repair work being planned. By January 2012 the island has become much more managed with a small visitor centre, toilets and OPW staff quarters located in newly furbished cottages above the main landing pier. There is a well managed and maintained way marked trail that guides the visitor around the main monastic remains, round tower and churches. There is what looks like a peat marina cut into the sod at the southern end of the E side. This is just N of the lighthouse. It could hardly have been a commercial success. The island has plentiful rabbit and in 1999, Golden Plover and a Short-eared Owl. Tides The tidal streams between the mainland and the islands tend to be stronger than between the islands. In each case they flow southeast with the flood and northwest with the ebb. Landing and Camping Land on Scattery at a muddy-sandy beach at a pier towards the northern end of the E side. Also, less conveniently further over S towards the battery/lighthouse. Camping is possible anywhere, but permission is needed from Dúchas.

It is widely accepted that tidal streams inshore in the shallows turn before tidal streams offshore. The islands and the much-fragmented coastline sets up eddies. The bays and inshore channels, from the Shannon Estuary in the southwest to Lough Swilly in the far north, fill and empty almost simultaneously. The variation between them is twenty minutes or less. This inshore cycle of bay filling and emptying is associated with the offshore main stream. As soon as the offshore stream begins to slacken off, the inshore streams start to flow in the opposite direction. Here is how it works. <strong>The offshore mainstream floods</strong> north until 3:05 after Galway HW, but inshore, the bays start to empty that bit earlier, at 1:00 after Galway HW. The inshore bays start to empty as soon as the offshore flood starts to slacken. <strong>The offshore mainstream ebbs</strong> south until 3:20 before Galway HW, but inshore, the bays start to fill that bit earlier, at 5:00 before Galway HW. The inshore bays start to fill as soon as the offshore ebb starts to slacken. To summarise, the bays mostly fill on the offshore flood and they mostly empty on the offshore ebb. It is just that the inshore cycle starts 1.5 – 2.0 hours earlier than offshore. As soon as the offshore flood or ebb slackens to about half pace, the process is exhausted and the inshore cycle the other way is triggered. Thus, all the bays and channels on the west coast fill from about 5:00 before Galway HW and empty from about 1:00 after Galway HW. Water movement in bays It has to be stressed that these timings relate to the entrances to bays. Up near the head of a bay, or even halfway up, the timing tends to be that bit later. Further, in bays where a large expanse of water is filled through a narrow or constricted entrance, it can be very much later. Bays with restricted entrances, into which large rivers flow, operate to rules that are more extreme again. The information that is commercially available about west coast tides relates to entrances of bays. The people who draw charts and write pilot books concentrate their efforts here. The reason is that mariners are always anxious to come and go with a favourable tide. Given that the west coast of Ireland consists almost entirely of such bays, this is very useful. The conscientious route planner is remarkably well informed for large sections of the coast.

The SW Clare coastline is synonymous with vertical slate cliffs. These begin at Kilbaha in the Shannon Estuary, just E of Loop Head and run NE for 60<em>km</em> or so, uninterrupted except for the occasional small boulder beach or long sweep of sand. The cliffs go all the way to the limestone Burren hills in the N of the county. There are few enough landings among the limestone escarpments between Doolin and Ballyvaughan. Steep cliffs then give way to the deeply indented bays in low-lying farmland on the NE edge of the Burren. Those who have set themselves to paddle all the way around Ireland, a mighty crew, properly fear the southern section of this county, from Loop Head to Doolin. It is one of the significantly exposed parts of the entire trip. West Clare is here divided into small day excursions, which allow one to intensively explore.</p>\n",

Embarkation is at Cappagh Pier at Q985-540 which is also the embarkation for Scattery Island. The rocky shoreline E of here goes all the way to Aylevarroo Point at Q997-529, the low-lying point on the horizon to the E. To the W lies the entrance to Kilrush Creek Marina. Access through the lockgates at Q984-544 is easy in season when the gates are normally manned. Call on VHF Channel 80 to be certain. From the Creek, a stony shoreline extends to Querrin, past the mouth of Poulnasherry (OysterHole) Bay. Poulnasherry is a tidal inlet, so don’t explore on an ebbing tide. Querrin Spit encloses an interesting, marshy area, accessible only above LW, 3<em>km</em> W of the mouth of the Poulnasherry marsh. At Querrin, there is a handy embarkation point with good road access at the pier and slipway in front of the handball alley at Querrin Quay at Q925-541. Best avoid the lower tides for fear of slime. Corlis Point is at Q915-530, followed by rocky reefs. Next is stony Doonaha Beach at Q883-527, where a caravan park and gun battery can be seen. Just E of Carrigaholt is Haughs Bay, secluded in that access is easier from the sea than from the land. Beware of LW at Carrigaholt, which leaves a mudflat inside the old quay (one of Nimmo’s).

The bay S of Carrigaholt is Kilcredaun and has an isolated stone beach below the Irish College visible above. The well-preserved Carrigaholt Castle is prominent on the point SE of Carrigaholt. There is a battery on top of Kilcredaun Point at Q850-494. Six such batteries were built towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars to guard the estuary against a French invasion. They were built in matching pairs. This one is matched by a similar construction on the Kerry side at the Cliffs of Dooneen at Q885-478. Upstream, the next two are at Scattery Island and Carrig Island. The last two are at Kilkerin Point and Tarbert Island, where the estuary is at its narrowest and most tortuous. Batteries were a more formidable proposition than Martello Towers. Martello Towers are a common feature on the E coast, but there are only two on the W coast. Both of these are in N Clare. Batteries were Dshaped or semicircular, and had much bigger armaments. These normally included 2 howitzers on the roof of the blockhouse and 6 guns along the outer perimeter. Typically, a battery also had a dry moat and a drawbridge. Scattery Island battery is in good condition although access to the roof is no longer possible. Kilkerin Point has been renovated in recent years. A school of porpoise and Bottlenose Dolphin are resident between this point and the Kerry coast for a number of years. They make full use of the sweeping tides to feed and frolic.  A credible eco-tourism industry has set up around these pods. Rinevella Bay has a pebble beach with a sunken bog and forest at its western extremity at Q817-493. Next, Rehy Hill at Q801-484 slopes gently into the water. Kilcloher Head at Q773-474 has a cave and marks the end of an impressive section of cliffs, including some long narrow caves and ‘The Opera House’ – undercut layers of rock sloping into the water.  Land at the pier, Nimmo’s prettiest according to some. Tides Tidal streams are strong at Kilcredaun Head at Q851-493 where the estuary suddenly narrows and turns southwest after its long westerly progression to the Atlantic.

Kilbaha is a wild place, pretty, and remote. Best to approach by road from the N, the Bridges of Ross side. The coastal road along the estuary from Carrigaholt is often blocked at Rinevella Bay (Q823-497) by storm damage. The bay is closed out in stormy conditions, so the road is sometimes blocked with shingle or bigger. Note how Kilbaha Pier is constructed without any mortar at all. There are two pubs and basic facilities. The Lighthouse pub does excellent bar food. A paddle to Ross Bay or the Bridges means a short road walk back, allowing a mighty paddle with no logistics or shuttle. Kilbaha has slipway access with shelter from off-lying reefs sloping into the bay. A little hut with caves underneath marks the SW extent of Kilbaha Bay. The outermost 6<em>km</em> of the Shannon Estuary has the character of the coast outside it. Tides now play a significant role as wind from the S can cause unpleasant sea states. Along the striking cliffs towards the head are many narrow caves, including one cavern whose narrow entrance causes light to refract upwards through the water. Halfway between Loop Head and Kilbaha is Dunmore Head at Q718-466 where a sheltered break may be had inside. Dunmore Head is almost cut off, and is locally called Horse Island. There is a wonderful cave running N/S through the headland. There is a very steep storm beach just E of Loop Head where landing is possible in good conditions. SPA Peregrine, Chough.</p>\n",

It consists of vertical black cliffs over 30m high. There is a detached section right at the head itself. This is called Diarmuid and Gráinne’s Rock. It is a vertical tower 100m by 20m, separated from the mainland by a deep, narrow gorge. In very calm conditions, it is possible to paddle through this gap. Diarmuid and Gráinne fled from Fionn and the Fianna, a long time ago. Their near capture is recorded widely all over Ireland in places named after them, such as this. From the mainland, marvel at the cairn on top of the rock and wonder how it got there. It wasn’t Diarmuid or Gráinne. Mick Fowler and Steve Sustad, two English climbers, put it there in 1990. They have specialised in climbs such as this. They abseiled down, swam out, climbed up, and then tyroleaned back (shinnied along a rope suspended between rock and mainland) to the mainland, leaving their mark behind. The feat has not been repeated. Around the Head, there is always a swell, which booms on the off-lying reefs. There is a huge lighthouse which is rarely visible from below, except from way out. The cliffs relent after Black Rock at Q703-490. The view southwards from here looks bleak as rising black cliffs stretch out to sea. The detached rock, 2<em>km</em> NE of the head, is Gull Island at Q701-482. The prominent point by it is Bullaunaleama, with its significant arch, with hundreds of birds occupying its ledges. 3<em>km</em> ENE of the Head lie two shallow bays with storm beaches where landing is possible, Fodry Bay and Ross Bay at Q733-500, handy to the road. The Bridges of Ross is a N facing, natural harbour. Once there were two bridges, but one fell into the sea. The remaining one is on the western side of the mouth of the inlet, just E of the Point of Ross. There are two inlets within the harbour. Access is normally easier from the wider one, being the more E of the two. There is a track down to a boulder beach. The bay is not completely cut off in rough conditions, as the mouth is wide enough. Care should be exercised though.</p>\n",

Goleen Bay is an excellent waystop and possible embarkation point, well sheltered, but beware of rough seas closing out its narrow entrance during big sets. The castle at Castle Point (Q835-577) cannot now be seen. The deeply undercut cliff here is popular with mackerel fishermen. From Goleen Bay to here are steeply sloped rock layers dipping straight into the sea. Offshore lies the distinctively shaped Illaunonearaun at Q827-570. There is no landing but it boasts fine arches and caves at its NE tip. SPA Storm Petrel, Barnacle Goose. There is a lovely arch at Foohagh Point at Q853-590, but watch for the submerged rock on its northern side. There is a most beautiful stack to its S called Green Pillar Rock, also called ‘The Candle’ by divers. A large hole has eroded through the centre, and there is a splendid jump off the landward side of the hole. The bay just N of Bishop’s Island at Q856-595 has the remains of some huts. There is a straight, 200m long cave in the SW corner. The island itself is visible only from the land opposite, and no landing is possible to kayaks. There are caves in the cliff wall opposite Bishop’s Island and a mighty sea stack on the corner. Clapotis often occurs in the sound, especially in the shallower, inside part. Approaching Kilkee Bay, just outside Duggerna Rocks, are a couple of nice caves, with the innermost having two entrances. The second is almost hidden by the big rock sticking up in the corner, or at HW. Waves tend to rear up between here and Knockroe Point to the S. The bay just to its S is Intrinsic Bay, where Goat Island is the tiny sloping rocklet heavily populated with birds. Avoid the tiny inlet behind the island. On Duggerna Rocks, at the southern side of the bay, are the famous Pollock Holes. These are famous for their natural swimming and snorkelling pools of all sizes. Covered at HW, they are refreshed twice daily. The Pollock Holes are deservedly a most popular attraction. The offshore rocks at this point are busy divesites. The inner bay has a beautiful, horseshoe strand, which is very well sheltered. As the town is right behind, the best landing is at the pier at the northern end of the beach. Scuba divers, both CFT and PADI (Comhairle Fo-Thuinn (Irish Underwater Council), Professional Association of Diving Instructors), organise themselves from this pier. Kilkee is a serious player as a tourist town. At the northern end of Kilkee Bay, a number of underwater reefs run S from George’s Head. These are known by frightened kayakers to boom on even the calmest days. The sheltered Byrne’s Cove at Q883-614 on the N side of the bay is popular with male naturists. The prevailing south-westerly swells, coupled with reflection off the cliffs, makes for turbulent water in this corner of the bay.</p>\n",

Kilkee to Farrihy Bay is about 5<em>km</em> and is a pleasant trip with rock layers, sloping steeply into the sea. George’s Head protects Kilkee Bay. The head has a cave opening to the S. The bay just to the N is Chimney Bay. Offshore are two rocky outcrops. That nearer Kilkee is known as Biraghty More at Q883-633, which is a popular scuba divesite. It boasts a good jump into the sea on the landward side. Facing Biraghty More on Corbally Point is a small cave. Further N is Biraghty Beg. Farrihy Bay has a reef at the mouth. On the southern side of the bay is Corbally village where landing is possible, but there is a long carry to the road. Corbally village is mostly holiday cottages now, but the native villagers were noted Irish speakers up to 1950 or so. Clerical and lay ‘<em>Gaelgeoirí</em>’ were common visitors in summer months. There is a rocky beach at the NE corner of the bay with good road access, but sharp reefs force a long carry at LW. This is not a rough weather landing spot by any means. Donegal Point at Q896-654 is turbulent at most times. It separates Farrihy Bay from a small, sheltered inlet to its N, called Bealnalicka. There is a rock beach here with steep access above the inlet to an in-fill quarry, which has road access. There are splendid caves at the inner, southern side of the inlet. One cave is a gem. It goes all the way S, through the headland into Farrihy Bay. The roof of the cave has collapsed halfway along, and being open to the sky, there are curious lighting effects even in poor ambient light conditions. Expect rough conditions at the southern entrance to the cave, and in the middle. Two reefs run outwards from the N entrance to the caves. Ballard Bay is noted for its sheer spectacular cliffs. Visit the caves inside a distinctive notch called the Horse Shoe at Q905-658. The caves are in the southern side of the bay, just W of the Napoleonic signal tower at Q910-656. A rocky shoreline leads around the headland to Carrickfadda known locally as the Blue Pool, a rock ledge at the outer NW end of the headland. Carrickfadda is popular with fishermen, despite some being tragically swept out to sea by boomers over the years. On the W side of Doonbeg Bay, there is the remains of a castle at Killard Point. There is good road access to a sheltered slipway at Q953-673. Access is also possible at HW, right up into Doonbeg itself, at a slipway N of the bridge, at Doonbeg Castle.

        "description": "<p><strong>Doonbeg to Spanish Point</strong> Q962-663 to R034-777   Sheet 57 The character of the coast all the way from Loop Head to Spanish Point is mostly steep, rugged, slate cliffs interspersed with sheltered bays, large and small. S of Doonbeg, the terrain is mostly suited to those who like to potter and explore in detail. This now gives way to exposed surf beaches. The coast 9<em>km</em> N of Doonbeg is mostly surf beach, including the famous Doughmore (White Strand on the OS 1:50,000 map). Doughmore is famous with surfers for its reliable surf and mean rip-tides. Do not lightly decide to land hereabouts. Rock has been placed at the toe of the dunes. Doughmore is famous with others for the golf played in the dune system behind the beach. Doonbeg Golf Course was developed controversially in the last few years. Golfers won out against conservationists. More recently, the golfers have applied to Clare County Council for permission to deposit 80,000 tons of rock and boulders at various points on Doughmore beach, to halt coastal erosion. Did they not realise that dunes are by definition impermanent? Was this not on the cards from the outset? This is one of the most beautiful remote and natural beaches in Ireland. While the land belongs to the golf course, the beach belongs to everyone. It is not the public’s fault if some of the greens were badly situated. The pier (by Nimmo) at Lurga Point, 2<em>km</em> WSW of the village of Quilty, has a NE facing slipway at Q996-742, sheltered by a reef.  There is access at all stages of the tide and parking is plentiful.  Lurga is a most convenient embarkation point for off-lying Mutton Island. There is a somewhat sheltered storm beach R020-761 just 1<em>km</em> S of Caherrush Point R020-768. Here are farms and generally a welcoming environment, with water and camping on request. In 2010 the local farmer is as pleasant and helpful as ever and has no difficulty with visitors as long as it is small numbers and they ask permissionto access or use the land. There is a great story about his father RIP who accomodated a fellow in a “skinny boat” many years ago. The curved beach immediately S of Spanish Point is a famed surf spot, absolutely to be avoided except in calm conditions. One can expect waves that often are higher than Lahinch itself, with the break line closer to the shore.</p>\n",

The main concern will be the sea swell. Unless conditions are very benign, there will be many hidden reefs below the surface and almost any swell will produce boomers. Keep 2/2.5<em>km</em> off Spanish Point itself.  Until well with Liscannor Bay, one must be on the lookout at all times and in every direction. Once around the point, head back in towards the bay at Cleadagh Bridge R037 797. There are one or two small unremarkable caves along the low cliffs. A stony beach is inaccessible in larger swell. White Strand (“Travaun”) is a very sheltered bay and accessible at any time R038-806. You can expect a breaking wave off Freagh Point R032-816 and another boomer 300<em>m</em> out from this on a low reef.  Paddling between these two waves is unpredictable.

Hag’s Head lies 3<em>km</em> W of Furreera (R042-880 Sheet 57) in Liscannor Bay, or about 6<em>km</em> W of Liscannor Harbour (one of Nimmo’s). Small parties will start or finish this classic excursion at Furreera. Larger parties may prefer Liscannor, as it has the better parking, easy access at the harbour, and in the village itself, facilities including restaurants, pubs, hotel and hostel. The Cliffs of Moher are the highest vertical cliffs in Ireland. Except for one stack off O’Brien’s Tower, and a few storm beaches, landings are few. Even then, these are only accessible in very settled conditions. These cliffs provide the most dramatic and committing day paddle in Ireland. If doing the Cliffs of Moher, choose light winds, or south-easterlies, which will wash over the top. Supreme Surfing Wave <em>Aill na Searrach</em> (a.k.a. <em>Aileens</em>) is Ireland’s biggest and best surfing wave, at over 10m, thought to be among the top five waves in the world.  The wave is close inshore, just N of Branaunmore. It was known for years but never surfed until recently.  Efforts began October 2004 but standard techniques were found wanting.  Surfers came from Australia, USA and the UK to try their luck.  Eventually on 15<sup>th</sup> October 2005, surfers were brought out to the site from Doolin.  Getting onto the wave involves being towed a by jet-ski, which then makes a hasty retreat, tactics not then necessary anywhere else in Ireland.  Conditions only get suitable a few times every year.  The wave spills into the base of the cliffs themselves, so its danger is not just its size.  Keep away, unless you are one of a very small handful of experts. Doolin claims, with some validity, to be the secret capital of Irish music. It is Mecca to every hitchhiker and cycling tourist under the age of sixty to visit Ireland. Doolin boasts excellent music, hostels, camping (in a paying site conveniently at the harbour), seafood restaurants, chippers, as well as everything touristy. Doolin Pier at R057-970, Sheet 51 is the obvious embarkation place for the Aran Islands. Inisheer lies 8<em>km</em> to the WNW, or 10<em>km</em> to the main beach. The slipway at Doolin pier is steep, less than well sheltered, and busy. Parking in summer is easier just 100m N, in front of the campsite. The launching is no more difficult off the rocky beach, despite a small, awkward carry. There is no other embarkation for many a cliff-bound mainland mile on either side. Day excursions either side of Doolin are committing and amongst the best in the country. Going S the first get out is approx 15<em>km</em> at Liscannor and even this is weather dependant. Going N the next get out is approx 16<em>km</em> at Fanore and this is very weather dependant also. After this the certain get out is at Gleninagh Pier another 8<em>km</em> further on, inside Galway Bay. Doolin has a coast and cliff rescue service. Contact Mattie Shanahan at 065 – 7074415, the leader of the local Coastguard (Doolin) Unit. Local information may be had from any of the local ferrymen, there being a number of busy, small ferry routes to the islands. SPA Peregrine, Chough.</p>\n",

It is best known these days for the reliable right-hand reef break off its SW side. Surfers ignore the nearby break on the mainland off Ballaghaline Point at R057-969, because it dumps.

This was the first in a long line of mishaps and misunderstandings that undermined the 1916 Rebellion and essentially confined it to Dublin. Casement has remained a controversial figure ever since. Branded as homosexual to alienate American Irish public opinion at the time, to the puzzlement of students of the subject since, it appears actually that he was. The British were truthfully more upset by his exposition of third world abuses in the Congo and South America and elsewhere, but were happy to seize upon his treason in support of the Irish cause of the time.</p>\n",

This comprises exposed limestone rock pavements, crags, escarpments, sea cliffs, caves, and above all, flowers. <strong>Flora</strong> – the Burren is profuse with rare wild flowers. Some of these are not otherwise found N of southern latitudes, while others are not found S of northern latitudes – here, they are side by side. The Burren shelves or drops vertically into the sea from Doolin to Ballyvaughan, with landings few and far between. <strong>Climbing cliffs</strong> – halfway between Doolin and Fanore is the famous climbing sea-cliff of Ailladie at R092-034, developed since 1972. It is probably second only in popularity in Ireland to Dalkey Quarry in Dublin. The tallest smooth section is Mirror Wall, with the only apparent weakness being The Ramp [E1 5b] winding up from bottom left to top right, pioneered by Dermot Somers. The cleanest of the series of square-cut corners just S of Mirror Wall is <em>Pis Fliuch</em> [HVS 4C], a committing layback. It is very much amongst the best of Jimmy McKenzie’s many fine legacies to Irish climbing. Further S by about 100m or more, look for the prominent Great Balls of Fire [E1 5b], said to be Brian Walker’s best. It is the obvious fist-sized crack rising to twothirds height from a ledge just above sea level; the escape is left and up. There are other cliffs, large and small, between Doolin and Ailladie, and there has been some climbing development on the more prominent sections. All other Clare climbing will always be second rate to Ailladie. <strong>Landings</strong> – there is a possible landing at a storm beach just a <em>km</em> N of Doolin, but it is of little logistical interest as there is no road access. There is a shallow bay with a steep slip about 4<em>km</em> S of Fanore beach, just where the road is closest to the high tide mark, but landing even here is troublesome under the best of conditions. A dolphin, <em>Fáinne,</em> arrived here in 1997 or so A dolphin, <em>Fáinne,</em> arrived here in 1997 or so and has remained ever since, though nowadays intermittently. 13.5<em>km</em> NE of Doolin and 4<em>km</em> or so S of Black Head, is the splendidly picturesque, dune-backed beach of Fanore at M137-085. The beach may dump even on a good day, but it is the nearest to a dependable landing on this stretch, so do not pass by without thought. Fanore has a public car park (height barrier) at the S end of the beach with water and excellent camping in a paying site at the N end of the beach. There is a lifeguard on duty most of the summer. The coast for kilometres on either side of Black Head is scenic, and of special interest to shore anglers. Lines of them grace the low but sheer black cliffs all summer long. At the head, with its huge automated lighthouse, there will always be swell, especially when the tide ebbs into the regular westerlies. Under normal summer conditions, full-blooded Atlantic conditions suddenly yield to the protected waters of Galway Bay. Travelling northwards, the views of the hills of North Clare from hereabouts are at their most stunning. 3<em>km</em> around Black Head, the tiny pier (marked Coolsiva Quay at M181-108) at Gleninagh, gives a landing onto a small sandy beach. This is a pleasant spot for swimming, and is usually a reliable landing. There is camping and water in nearby houses. Car access is awkward, especially for larger groups. Many of the ‘Wild Geese’ are said to have left from this pier in Sarsfield’s time, after the Treaty of Limerick in 1691. 4<em>km</em> WNW of Ballyvaughan is Gleninagh Castle. Landing is difficult hereabouts, but it is worth the trouble as the castle is well preserved and home to breeding Chough.</p>\n",

In particular, spits of land enclose the Harbour, keeping it distinguished from Ballyvaughan Bay immediately outside to the North. The Harbour is enclosed from NW by ‘The Rine’, an attractive grassy spit that juts out NE from the shore W of the village, the tip of which is at M222-097, and from NE by Green Island M236-093, a breeding spot for mute Swan, the end of a rough marshy area jutting out from Bishops Quarter to the NE of the village.  The Rine is an attractive tourist walk and families often get cut off at HW.  Green Island is less attractive and generates less problems, if any. Gall Island M234-086 lies inside Rine and Green, a mere 200m off the new pier in Ballyvaughan M232-085 and shelters it.  With a huge LW footprint it was formerly a noted seaweed provider.  The harvest was formed into rafts and floated towards the collection point, beside the shed to its E. The shed is just off the main road at M238-084 and was the commercial hub of the enterprise.  It is now unused. Seaweed lost its commercial value in the early 1980s when an iodine factory at Maam Cross in Connemara closed. Camping at the village is very public, on grass in front of the Rent an Irish Cottages, or just W of the old quay M028-085. It may be possible elsewhere with permission. A better choice by far, is Bishop’s Quarter beach 1.5km NE at M245-095.  It is possible except at lowest waters to paddle inside Green Island all the way to Bishop’s Quarter. Ballyvaughan is a very pretty village, with all supplies. It is probably best known with tourists for the seafood in Monks Bar at the (old) W pier, and cakes and delicacies in the Tea Rooms nearby. There is also the commercial Aillwee Cave, 3<em>km</em> to the S inland.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Scanlan’s Island</strong> M253-104          Sheet 51 Scanlan’s Island is a low, cultivated, agricultural island set out in large fields, lying 3.5<em>km</em> NE of Ballyvaughan. It is barely an island, being cut off only at HW, and being circumnavigable only on the very highest tides. The rest of the time it is accessible by land from the N at M258-115, near Finavarra village. Scanlan’s is noted here for the tidal race that sets up on the ebb at the narrows at its southern tip at M252-103. This is between the island and the mainland where Poulnaclogh Bay flows into Ballyvaughan Bay. The race runs due W. A significant height difference is discernible over as little as 50m, and the runoff in springs, with wind over, can go for over 500m. Tide Race Paddlers prefer playing in this race to the more powerful Aughinish Point race nearby, because of its ease of access and relative safety of escape. This race flows into the enclosed Ballyvaughan Bay, whereas Aughinish flows into the more open water of Galway Bay. It is shallow and bumpy with even a hint of westerlies – good fun to be in. Access is from Bishop’s Quarter beach at M245-095, 1<em>km</em> SW and 2<em>km</em> NE of Ballyvaughan. The beach is easily accessible to vehicles, with a good car park and camping. Ballyvaughan has all facilities. Slack water immediately outside the narrows is as Galway HW and LW. The stream at the narrows and inside Poulnaclogh Bay can be up to +0100 flooding and ebbing. The most powerful flow at the narrows is the first part of the ebb. This is normal for such configurations, especially after heavy rain, as some fresh water fills Poulnaclogh Bay.  Indeed the surface water downstream of the narrows can taste quite fresh.  The lower half of the ebb usually yields longer flatter waves, a bit less confused, that bit more amenable.  However, the situation is very variable. The whole area teems with bird life in winter. On land is found Snow Bunting, on Loch Murree Whooper mute and even Whistling Swan in 2010, beside regular winter Widgeon, Pochard and Teal. On the sea there are Brent Goose, many Merganser, Long-tailed Duck, and especially Divers. More than 130 Great Northern Diver have been counted in recent times. The area is particularly noted for the rarer Black Throated Diver. Clive Hutchinson’s ‘Birds in Ireland’ records a flock of 18 in 1985. Singles and small groups are regular visitors. Grey Phalarope were seen here in significant numbers in October 2001.</p>\n",

Apparently, Aughinish was only ever completely cut off from the mainland for about 50 years. Of old, it was joined to County Clare at New Quay to the S. Then a destructive tidal wave, caused by an earthquake off Lisbon, Portugal on 1<sup>st</sup> November 1755, swept into the area with such force it broke that connection. The Lisbon earthquake is said to have been the most focussed destructive seismic event in recorded history, measured at 9.0 on the Richter scale and lasting seven full minutes (San Francisco 1906 was 7.8 and lasted 30 seconds).  For a time Aughinish remained an unattached island. But then the military constructed the Martello Tower (1804 – 1810) in fear of Napoleonic invasion. For access, they built a road across a causeway at M295-133 from the E, in County Galway. That <em>tsunami</em> also flattened Correnroe Castle to the SE at the head of Correnroe Bay. Thus is explained the puzzling position of an ancient ruined church on the SW, opposite the Clare coast.  The same event caused major destruction at Barley Cove in west Cork, leaving the extensive dune system behind now apparent. Circumnavigation This provides kayakers with an opportunity for a short but interesting circumnavigation without logistical problems. Aughinish Point at M274-132 is at the W tip of the island. For best conditions, the circuit is best done clockwise if launching on the ebb, or anticlockwise on the flood.

It extends over the entire mouth of the bay and stretches from New Quay Pier to Aughinish Point and beyond. On the northern side of the island, the tides are not generally strong. However, a shallow bar extends from Deer Island ESE to a point northeast of Aughinish Island Martello Tower, where some rough water may be encountered. Until 1992, there was an old cannon, with emplacements, on top of the Martello Tower, but these are now gone. The top used to be reached with difficulty by climbing, but the tower is now a private residence. This is one of only three such towers built on the W coast. The others are at M241-117 Finavarra Point a few _km_s to the WSW, commanding the entrance to Ballyvaughan Bay, which still sports its gun, and at Rossaveal L956-238. The S side of the island was the scene of a tragic drowning on 29th June 1969, when 9 children, all from New Quay (except one from Kinvara), died when a boat overturned on its maiden sea trials. At the pier at New Quay, which was built by Nimmo, is Linnane’s Bar, renowned seafood bar and restaurant. <strong>County Galway</strong> The coast of S Galway consists of low-lying, deeply indented farmland on the N edge of the Burren area.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Island Eddy</strong> M351-164          Sheet 52 Eddy is a large and pretty island, low-lying, 2<em>km</em> NW of the mouth of Kinvara Bay. Formerly inhabited by seven families, Eddy was abandoned in 1947. The islanders settled on the mainland nearby, mostly at Doorus and Clarinbridge. The village is in a line set back from the beach at the northern side of the E end. It is now mostly in ruins and overgrown, though one house has been restored as a holiday home.  Deciduous trees behind the village gave good shelter. The island is grazed in summer. The bigger part of the island lies W of the village and is reached by a narrow causeway. There are enormous lagoons on the northern and south-western sides. A coral sandbank projects from the eastern end of the island. This dries out all the way to the mainland at the bottom of very low spring tides, when Razorfish can be dug on the lowest parts. Embarkation Put in at a choice of launchings.

        "description": "<p><strong>Tawin Island</strong> M300-193          Sheet 51 Kilcolgan Point at M300-193 at the W tip of the island is a useful waystop for a tour in inner Galway Bay. Land onto boulders and slabs, on whichever side is sheltered. The island is accessible by road, and is flat but interesting. Tawin is used here to describe a large area, being a long narrow peninsula with the island at its extremity.  Accessed from Clarinbridge or easier from Oranmore, both on the Galway Limerick road, the area includes the main island Tawin West and for two other islands (Inishcorra and Tawin East), besides a part of the mainland called Mweenish Island, which is actually attached at all stages of the tide.  The area is in the Galway commuter belt, and there is a lot of one off housing. The whole thing is lovely and includes two Nimmo piers. Best known feature of the region is the Oranmore Sailing Club at the small Rinville pier (one of Nimmo’s) at M355-219 on sheet 46, well signposted.  Inside Rinville Point, the peninsula encloses a marine insititute, an hotel, and a golf course.  There is a lovely walk along the shore to the point, and for the energetic, a walk along the N shore to beyond the golf course, where it is possible to access the woodland in the interior and thereby, back to the starting point.  Well recommended. Mweenish in the extreme S is actually the remotest part of the entire.  Except for two raised areas, one at each end WNW and ESE, it is largely salt marsh, only occasionally below the waterline.  One could camp here and be undisturbed for a week. Short grass and clean seas make the prospect attractive.  The OS 1:50,000 shows the area as detached, but the old half inch shows it correctly as definitely mainland.  The views southward to the Burren are stunning.  Land access is strictly from the WNW, which is a long way by boreen from the nearest road.  It may be possible to arrive on foot from the NE at LW springs.  Oyster farming is carried out intensively in the sheltered bay to the NE.  Access from the Nimmo quay at 360-181, called locally Lynch’s Quay. Inishcorra is a working farm area, not to be disturbed unnecessarily.  Access on foot is from Tawin East to the NW at HW.  Signs hereabouts refuse permission for the hunting of hares, and trespassing generally. The strip of land projecting W on the S side that with the Tawins on the N side encloses the Inishcorra Bay area is called Glasheen Island.  It is best known for the wreck of the <em>Pamela</em> that came ashore here without loss of life. Tawin East is really a part of the road to Tawin West that happens to have a bridge at each end.  It is otherwise undistinguishable from mainland.  Tides flow extremely forcefully under the bridge on the E side.  This area is popular for kayak training. The school and houses on Tawin West are close to the Tawin East bridge.  Further west the land is barer, and sheep graze, some cattle too.  There is a swimming beach on the N side at M305-195.  Periwinkles grow in industrial quantities around the W end History Eamon deValera met his wife Sinead here in 1911 when he was running an Irish summer college in the local national school.  Jack B. Yeats painted here, and photography opportunities abound.  It is a noted birding spot. Circumnavigation The island is at the head of a useful round trip with a simple shuttle between put in and out points. Start or finish on the N side at Oranmore Sailing Club at the small Rinville pier (one of Nimmo’s) at M355-219 on sheet 46, well signposted from Oranmore village.  On the S side, on Sheet 52, try the pier called locally Lynch’s Quay, 6<em>km</em> WSW of Clarinbridge at M360-181 where there is good parking, or at HW, and for the easier shuttle, try a quay at M407-197 just W outside of Clarinbridge. This provides a trip of 18<em>km</em> or so. Sheets 45,46 and 51 are needed.  There are nice west-going races on the lower ebb off Mweenish Point at M354-175, Sheet 52 (the E point of Mweenish Island) in the S. There are also races off St. Brendan’s Island at M326-213, sheet 46 in the N. Under normal winds, the trip is probably best done S to N. There are plenty of convenient escape points. There are splendid views of the nearby Galway City from the island. Visit Island Eddy village en route.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Hare Island</strong> M317-237          Sheet 45 A popular and attractive island about 1.5<em>km</em> SE of the entrance to Galway City docks and harbour.  A causeway to the NE dries out for about 90 minutes either side of LW, joining the island to the mainland at Ballyloughan Point in the suburb of Renmore, beside a camping and caravan park. There, a municipal sign warns that access to the island is prohibited in the interests of public safety.  Apparently the unwary get trapped there overnight from time to time, frightened by the strength of the flow crossing the causeway when the water levels rise more quickly than expected.  The sign seems to attract more traffic than it prevents, and certainly, groups can routinely be seen waiting on the dropping tide for the causeway to appear, then smartly setting out.   The discerning kayaker will visit at HW. The island is a raised green field on the W side, rising from the middle, with steep mud and grass cliffs around the higher parts.  The field features mainly ragweed and elder, with some brambles.  Rabbits abound.  No stock was seen August 2008 but a small construction suggests there must be at times. A lagoon flanked by a grass covered raised stoney perimeter comprises the E side.  The lagoon drains NE on the E side of the causeway.  It never empties much really, but it is renewed at each HW and is fresh looking and clear.  There is a small wreck on the ENE shore.  Herring Gull roost and appear to breed. Embarkation The suburb of Renmore boasts a paying camping and caravan park at M324-247, a nice beach, and some parking on the very limits of Galway city.  East of the point is green fields.  Launch from immediately outside the campsite M323-247.  Land on a sheltered stony beach on the N said just W of the causeway, where the swimming is better on lower tide levels.

        "description": "<p><strong>Mutton Island</strong> M297-233          Sheet 45 Situated 1<em>km</em> immediately S of the entrance to Galway City docks and harbour at the Claddagh. The main pier at Galway is the only one to be named after its designer – Alexander Nimmo, the great maritime engineer of the early 19<sup>th</sup> Century. No other one man changed the face of the west of Ireland more than he, ever. In the aftermath of the famine of 1821, the official response was to build up the infrastructure of western Ireland, which then lagged behind the rest of the United Kingdom, of which it was then part. He is responsible for 40 piers altogether between Waterford and Sligo, besides all the roadways we now call the national primary roads in the entire area from Clare to Mayo.  A practical visionary, he forced the official hand to keep building after the immediate effects of the famine had dissipated.  The results of his efforts made similar efforts in the great famine of the 1840s the more effective. A non-portageable causeway has joined Mutton to the mainland since 2000. The causeway facilitates a new sewerage treatment plant for the city, the location chosen in controversial circumstances in spite of protests from conservationists. Mutton is useful more as a pitstop than as a waystop. The whole island is taken over by the sewerage works, except for a small swampy portion on the eastern side. Land anywhere on the eastern side. Camping is forbidden… it would be very unattractive anyway. All Galway bound traffic keeps E of the island, and be careful at night. The low tower on the southern side is no longer a lighthouse. <strong>Aran Islands</strong> Sheet 51 The Aran Islands are an experience unlike anything else in Ireland, the maritime Burren, ruggedly beautiful.  Inisheer on the Clare side is the smallest, the prettiest, and the most accessible.  Inishmaan in the middle is the most traditional and remote, yet very progressive.  Inishmore is the largest, the most dramatic, almost mainlandlike, such is its popularity.  Inishmore can be accessed by air or ferry from Galway City, but most people head out by smaller craft from villages on the Clare or Galway coasts, Doolin or Rossaveal. Embarkation – Clare side Doolin in County Clare is the obvious embarkation place on the Clare side. Keep N of Crab Island at the harbour mouth, as the S side enjoys a world renowned reef surfwave. Inisheer is 8<em>km</em> WNW. There is no other embarkation point hereabouts, with cliffs for many kilometres either side. Embarkation – Galway side Passenger ferries go from Rossaveal. There is no one obvious embarkation point for kayaks on the Galway side for Inishmore. Set out from anywhere convenient on the Connemara coast, probably around Lettermullan.  Departure from the island N to the mainland requires care in identifying the landing spot, as the mainland coast is low-lying and rocky. The islands off the Connemara coast tend to merge with the mainland background. The best navigational markers are the signal tower on Golam Head and the small, automated lighthouse on Croaghnakeela.

South Sound between Inisheer and the County Clare mainland achieves only 1kn in springs and North Sound between Inishmore and the mainland even less, 0.5kn. Streams in the middle two sounds east and west of Inishmaan are much stronger. Be careful of both central sounds with wind against tide, which occurs mostly on the ebb as prevailing winds are from the southwest. The stream between Inishmaan and Inishmore, called Gregory’s Sound, reaches 1.5kn in springs. Also, being surrounded by cliffs, quite a sea state rises in Gregory’s Sound. In westerly winds, a sea state occurs when the swell claps against the cliffs on the southwest of Inishmaan. The stream between Inishmaan and Inisheer, called Foul Sound, also reaches 1.5kn in springs, but lacks the reputation of Gregory’s Sound, there being no cliffs.</p>\n",

It has several small off-liers, dealt with here as a group. With its airport and all-weather ferry from Galway City, Inishmore, especially around the town Kilronan, has a very ‘mainland’ feel to it. Landings L883-088        Kilronan pier (<em>Cill Rónáin)</em>, for all mainland type facilities. L887-073        Killeany <em>(Cill Éinne)</em> pier, by Nimmo, near the airport.  Remote. L828-105        Kilmurvey (<em>Cill Mhuirbhigh</em>), W of centre on the northern side, has a sheltered sandy beach. The best campsite is on a grassy area on the western side of the bay, just N of the beach. This is just the other side of a pier, where there is an easy rocky landing, and good water in a well. This is the obvious departure point on passage NW. L777-116        Bungowla (<em>Bun Gabhla</em>), a sheltered pier and slip, facing across the sound to the Brannock Islands at the W end of the island. Sheltered slipway, manageable camping, water. This is the jumping off point for the navigation of the Dun Aengus cliffs, the unbroken 16<em>km</em> line of cliffs of the SSW side of Inishmore. This passage is a major challenge for kayakers. L831-092        In exceptionally calm conditions, in someone else’s empty plastic boat, or in extreme distress, there is the possibility of a landing at about midpoint on the SSW coast. This is under Gortnagapple (<em>Gort na gCapall</em>), 1<em>km</em> E of Dun Aengus. A sloping natural slipway lies at <em>Port Bhéal an Dúin</em> on the right hand side of the easterly of two bays, where the cliffs are lowest of all. Rumour has it that this place is very occasionally used by curraghs. This is the slipway made famous in the classic film ‘Man of Aran’. Otherwise, these cliffs are 14<em>km</em> of lee shore, best attacked from <em>Bun Gabhla</em> on the ebb tide in total calm, finishing Portdeha. L904-067        Portdeha.  A fine sandy beach protected by high dunes on S/W side.  Exposed to SE winds which may cause it to surf.  An attractive spot and well positioned for any run down the Dun Aengus cliffs from E or W.  Ideal place to take a stroll down towards Straw Island. No water found.  Camping would be a struggle, having to carry gear up the beach and over high dunes behind, besides then finding spots amongst tough marram grass. Certainly possible but areas of much easier camping abound. Mega-Clasts Clasts are any particles of solid rock broken down by erosion and deposited in a new setting.  Mega-clasts are huge such clasts.  Recorded in numerous other localities along the W Scottish and Irish seaboard, nowhere are mega-clasts as obvious as on the barren karst of Inismore.  What could be powerful enough to lift huge angular / isolated sections of wave-cut platform weighing up to 2.5 <em>tonnes</em> and catapult them 50<em>m</em> upwards and leave them stranded in linear heaps 50<em>m</em> inboard of the cliff top? Recent research has produced two theories.  These mega-clasts may be the result of “recent” tsunamis in the North Atlantic, say the last 1,000 years, estimated from the degree of weathering. These tsunamis are often set off by submarine landslides in Volcanic archipelagos such as the Azores. Alternatively, or maybe as well, a recent theory, developed in nearby Galway University, suggests mega-clasts have been brought about by “freak” storm waves. Conventional ideas on the size of storm waves are shifting due to reams of data gathered by worldwide tsunami alert buoy systems, as well as data from offshore rigs, in ultra deepwater 1500<em>m</em>+. If huge freak waves are actually high frequency events, this would have significant implications for ship design and maritime insurance. Freak waves are finding growing acceptance amongst the scientific community. <strong>Rock Island/Eeragh Island</strong></p>\n",

Landing is very difficult at the quay at the SE as it is subject to W / SW swells. Indeed it is marked on Tim Robinson’s map as hardly deserving of the name of ‘quay’. Robinson hopped off a curragh here, but landing a kayak would be ambitious. In calm seas, landing is possible on some rocky ledges further up the E side of the island. At the N end of the E side, there is a very small rocky beach, with some boulders, where there is another landing at LW to mid-tide. Camping is OK; there is no soil, but there is plenty of flat rock on the path to the lighthouse. The lighthouse sequence is FL 15s, 35m, 23M (one flash every 15 seconds, the light is 35 metres high and is visible for 23 miles). It was first established in December 1857 and was automated 1978. No water was found but a herd of goats survive, so there must be somewhere. In an emergency the Irish Lights tanks might be accessible.

Good easy landing onto shingle beaches in the N and E. No great merit. Major lighthouse (11 <em>m</em>. high) which flashes twice every 5 seconds. <strong>Connemara South</strong> <em>Conamara Theas</em> <strong>Galway City to Slyne Head</strong> <em>Cathair na Gaillimhe go Ceann Léime</em> <strong>County Galway</strong> <strong><em>Co. na Gaillimhe</em></strong> This section deals with the coastline from Rossaveel to Slyne Head. There are no islands, and no information available as to the coastline W of Galway City to Rossaveel. For convenience, the section is divided into its eastern and western halves. The eastern section is centred around Gorumna Island (Kilkieran Bay/Greatman’s Bay – <em>Cuan Chill Chiaráin/Cuan an Fhir Mhóir</em>), and Bertraghboy Bay – <em>Cuan na Beirtrí Buí</em> is in the W. The E section is further divided into three sections: Greatman’s Bay, the islands around Lettermullan Island between the entrances to Greatman’s Bay and Kilkieran Bay, and Kilkieran Bay itself. Historical Context The very first roads, bridges and piers among the bays and waters of Connemara – <em>Conamara</em> were constructed under the engineer Nimmo after the 1821 famine.  There was no fully functioning road transport system until the late 1800s. Well into the early 1900s, wooden sailing boats, Connemara Hookers, were the workhorses of these waterways. Hookers were a dominant feature of the Conamara landscape. They ferried goods – tea, sugar, flour and tobacco to small shops in outlying communities on the many inshore islands, and even transported turf to the Aran Islands. Before 1900, the region was among the poorest in Ireland. It was a harsh landscape. With hard labour, people were reasonably self-sufficient. They provided food and support for their families from farming, kelp gathering, fishing and trades. But there were groups who were very poor. Old people, widows with young children, or men with families and no land, all were vulnerable. Some years there was a poor harvest in fishing or potato. The Congested Districts Board was set up in the 1880s to develop infrastructural schemes, which helped to alleviate such poverty. A huge number of men were employed in building roads, causeways and bridges. The Board achieved more under British administration than would be achieved in the years immediately after Irish independence. The causeways and bridges which joined the islands to the mainland, and between the islands of Lettermullan – <em>Leitir Mealláin</em>, Gorumna – <em>Oileán</em> <em>Gharmna</em> and Annaghvaan – <em>Eanach</em> <em>Mheáin</em>, were built in the years between 1886 and 1891. Many roads in the Carna area were built then also. Men earned one shilling (about 6 cent) a day. 900 were working on these schemes from <em>Ceantar na n-Oileáin</em>, (<em>Leitir Móir</em> and <em>Leitir Mealláin</em>) which shows a huge reliance on these relief works to help families survive famine and high rents. About 1900, lace-making industries were set up to create income opportunities for women. It became a way for women to earn the price of a fare to America to escape from a life of poverty and hardship. The population were tenants on the land. It was a struggle to keep their holdings and to survive. Landlords and their agents charged exorbitant rents. Those who could not pay their rent were evicted. It drove many people to emigrate. There were many schemes in America and Australia around 1900 looking for ‘white healthy people’ to occupy and inhabit the ‘new countries’. It was the beginning of emigration on such a scale that it scourged the west of Ireland until about the 1970s. The emigrants’ destination changed in the 1950s to England where work was plentiful, due to the efforts to rebuild after World War 2.  In 2013 emigration is again the scourge of all Ireland. In the 1900s, all the islands in South Conamara were ravaged by poverty, emigration, and the hardships of making a living. This contrasted with how these same islands had previously provided people with food when many other parts of the country were starving. From the 1950s onwards, the final death knell for life on these islands came as people chose an easier lifestyle on the mainland. They preferred easier access to housing, electricity, health services, education for their children, and opportunities to work and earn money. Who were the people who came to live on these offshore rocky islands?  We are privileged to know mainly because of the Griffith’s Valuation Survey.  This was, ironically, a property tax survey that was carried out between the years 1847 and 1864.  It involved a detailed valuation of every taxable piece of agricultural land or built property, to get an accurate estimate of the annual income it should produce.  It listed names of occupiers, landlords, area and type of tenement.  The names of the occupiers then and landowners today on <em>Inis Oirc</em> have not changed significantly, though there is the addition of one family. The survey was used as a basis for local taxation for 100 years up to the late 1970s, when residential property tax was abolished, but now in 2013 it is back. <em>Inis Oirc</em> is one of six islands that form an archipelago of small islands on the outer western landmass of <em>Ceantar na n-Oilean, Conamara</em>. It is tucked away, a welcome haven, safe from the tides and turmoil of Golam Head. Five families lived on <em>Inis Oirc</em>. It is now abandoned. There were two families of Folans, two of Flahertys and one of McDonaghs. There were 40 children born to these families.  They endured tragedy and loss with the deaths of some 11 children in infancy. Children went to school on the mainland at <em>Leitir Meallain</em>. They lived by farming and fishing. Everything the families needed for the houses was brought ashore in currachs and was made use of.  As they grew older the children moved away and many settled on the mainland, while others emigrated to England and the USA. The last person left the island about 1984. Though the island is abandoned, the descendents of the people who left it still farm cattle there. In 2013, the Down Survey of 1656-1658 was digitised by TCD and published on the <em>www</em>, another valuable insight into the past and the ultimate land grab of Irish history, between 1641 and 1670.  This survey, the first of its kind in the world, was carried out after the Cromwellian Wars. It sought to measure all the land that the native Irish Clans would forfeit, to be redistributed to the mercenaries who fought for Cromwell. It was a survey which recorded townland boundaries and measured areas with great precision at a scale of 1:40 perches, almost equivalent to 1:50,000 today. It even put a value on remote islands that were difficult to land on, never mind remote mainland. In 2004, Oileáin was reporting that the government was making substantial improvements to the infrastructure of islands, extending and deepening harbours, and especially installing mains water / electricity on small inhabited islands.  Increasingly, many islands gained holiday homes.  For a time the tide seemed to be turning, but maybe it is ebbing again. The current hard economic times will surely discourage continuing investment, and the return of the taxation of residential property is hardly incentivising. These days, islands are a very attractive destination for paddlers and other tourists. Kayakers, whose goal whenever the opportunity arises, is to visit offshore islands and in particular lesser visited islands, are in a unique position to explore the winds of change. Their questioning and awareness starts the moment they get out of their boats. Usually, their interest centres on how people have lived, – buildings, fields, field boundaries, paths, piers/landings, all the trails of their existence. Many of these inshore islands were inhabited until the not too distant past. When we shelter alongside the old walls of the people who have travelled these same boreens before us, we should reflect on their lives and the drastic causes behind these settlement changes. <strong>Greatman’s Bay <em>Cuan an Fhir Mhóir</em></strong> Greatman’s Bay is the smallest of the three island strewn bays on the S-facing Galway coast. Greatman’s is bounded by the Carraroe – <em>An Ceathrú Rua</em> peninsula to the E and Gorumna Island and Lettermore Island to the W. Bealadangan – <em>Béal an Daingin</em> at the N connects Greatman’s Bay to Kilkieran Bay, for even quite large but unmasted vessels. Only the island free Cashla Bay – <em>Cuan Casla</em> just to the E is smaller among the great bays hereabouts. At this E end of the S <em>Conamara</em> coast, information is comparatively scant for the kayaker. This is so even though Carraroe is a famous tourist resort, and that Gorumna is Ireland’s fifth biggest offshore island. Let the knowledgeable reader accept the challenge, and furnish information to put matters right. Tides Local HW in the furthest regions of the bay such as Bealadangan is about 1:00 after Galway HW, all much as one expects.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"327\"><strong>Greatman’s Bay</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"66\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:00 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">Various</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">1:00 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"66\">Various</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The tide floods north and east through the narrows, ebbing south and west. Greatman’s Bay is much more open at its northern parts than is Kilkieran Bay, so the tide runs very strongly indeed through the remoter gaps. A flow of 4 – 5kn is reported at Bealadangan, but following this logic, much less may be expected at Kiggaul Bay – <em>Cuan Choigéil</em> where Gorumna meets Lettermullan to the west. As with other bays hereabouts, beware when navigating in the narrow places on a falling tide. One mistake and the kayak can be grounded, necessitating a long wait, or a muddy session dragging the boat over seaweed covered rocks in search of open water. <strong>Camus Bay <em>– Cuan Chamuis</em></strong> Camus Bay <strong>–</strong> <em>Cuan Chamuis</em> is the innermost bay among the myriad of islands at the head of Greatman’s Bay and Kilkieran Bay. The two bays are joined in places between the islands. Camus Bay is distinctive in that one can meet the tide ebbing from Camus Bay into Kilkieran Bay even as it floods into Camus Bay from Greatman’s Bay. This is due to the narrows that occur at L947-340 E of <em>Cladhnach</em> – Clynagh Island (off <em>Rosmuc</em>) further up the bay.

Lettermullan Island is central to more than half a dozen off-lyers on its W, NW and N. To the W, Golam – <em>Gólam</em>, Freaghillaun More – <em>Fraochoileán Mór</em> and Freaghillaun Beg – <em>Fraochoileán Beag_surround Crappagh – _An Chnapach</em>, which is itself attached to Lettermullan by an unmarked causeway/bridge of recent construction. Beware of the passage inside Crappagh at very LW. To the NW and N, Inisherk – <em>Inis Eirc</em>, Dinish – <em>Daighinis</em> and Illauncosheen (Illauncasheen locally) – <em>Oileán Chaisín</em> surround Furnace – <em>Fornais</em>, which is similarly attached to -Lettermullan. Lettermullan is joined on the E to Gorumna Island (and eventually to the mainland) by road bridges to the NE. The bridge between Lettermullan and Gorumna is passable with ease only at very HW but circumnavigators can get through all these gaps with effort at all stages. The gap between Crappagh and Lettermullan has extensive shallows and may be more difficult. Beware when navigating hereabouts on lower or dropping tides. Tides flow strongly, ebbing S or W through the narrows. Beside the Lettermullan/Gorumna bridge, on the Gorumna side, is a pub that serves good seafood. The northern shore has nothing interesting. The eastern shore has a number of working quays. The southern shore has a beautiful bay E of centre at L843-216, inside Dog Island – <em>Oileán an Mhadra</em>, and a wild, westerly section off which clapotis will always be present. Camping Camping for the tourer may be conveniently had at L826-215 on the remote commonage at the SW tip. This is just inside and opposite the signal tower at Golam Head on Golam Island, at the eastern side of a sheltered N-facing bay. The bay is created by Golam Island, which is not totally cut off.</p>\n",

Huge 19<sup>th</sup> Century signal tower forms the major landmark hereabouts. Very much recommended. Marked 95’ on half inch OS map. There is a race on ebb on northern side into a westerly wind. In fact, Golam Island is accessible on foot from Lettermullan, certainly in wellingtons, for some at least of the lower part of the tide. Golam Head – <em>Ceann Gólaim</em> at L817-214 is on Golam Island. Its elevated signal tower is a most prominent feature, which may be used as a visual navigational aid for many kilometres. The land hereabouts in South <em>Conamara</em> is otherwise low, confusing and difficult to identify, especially from seaward. This is the spot from which to embark for Inishmore on the Aran Islands, especially if heading for Bungowla at the western tip. More importantly though, coming from Aran, Golam Head is one of the few easily identifiable spots on the coast hereabouts (but in this context see also Croaghnakeela Island).</p>\n",

The E side has several working piers of little interest save as waystops. The gap inside Illauncosheen is barely passable, even to a kayak, at LW.</p>\n",

Ungrazed save by a single donkey, this is a small, unattractive island off the eastern side of Furnace. It provides shelter for the fleet of working boats operating from the pier opposite. Camping is theoretically possible at southern end. <strong>Kilkieran Bay</strong> <strong><em>Cuan Chill Chiaráin</em></strong> The bay N of Lettermore Island is mostly very shallow, giving paddling which varies greatly with the level of the tide. At HW, there are quite a few small islands, some inhabited, some not, and all with reasonably straightforward landings. As the tide falls, the flow between the islands increases and the channels all narrow. Some of the streams reach 3kn, and then the channels dry up, so that the whole area is seaweed-covered rocks and islets. Many of the islets then become linked at lower tides. The area is heavily dredged by fishermen for oysters and bladder-wrack seaweed. The seaweed is collected and taken away in trucks to be processed into iodine and fertiliser. There is also salmon farming. The local wildlife is spectacular with large numbers of seals, some of which are inquisitive, and otters, which quite definitely are not. Also, there are birds, Common, Herring and Lesser Black-backed Gull, and large numbers of Red Breasted Merganser. Worth visiting in its own right, the area is particularly attractive as a fallback in time of windy weather. Its combination of races and shelter can combine to give more fun than open ocean water. Embarkation From the W side, suitable for the middle section of the bay, put in is easiest at the harbour at Kilkieran L846-315itself, where there is good parking.  Kilkieran also boasts good provisions and a pub.  Smaller groups may prefer pretty Ardmore Quay L817-293 for the S end of the bay, where there is limited parking requiring courtesy.  Further N, the inner bay is easiest accessed from a smaller working quay at Flannery’s bridge in a deep inlet at L867-354.  Opportunities to put in on the E side of the bay are far too numerous to list and the choice will depend on the group and its itinerary.

A fine network of boreens make the island interesting to wander around. This is an attractive, non-intensively farmed, sheltered, low, inhabited island in E-mid-Kilkieran Bay. Hay is cut by scythe and saved in haycocks. There is a landing place with camping at a pier on the NE end, the more northerly of the two piers on the E side.  There is excellent water in a well 100m up the boreen behind the house at the pier. Otters. An unusual feature is the ancient square bay cut into the old NE pier, intentionally, to house “cattle rafts”. These flat square rafts can take a dozen cows, to be transported to another part of the island, or death, or whatever.  They are still in use.

The passage under the bridge is passable at the higher parts of the tide. One Corncrake was heard singing here in 2003. Mweenish is the home place of the Galway Hooker, the traditional wooden, gaff-rigged, tumble-homed sailing boat of the W coast of Ireland. Hookers very nearly went extinct as a working boat a century ago, but have enjoyed a considerable revival since about 1970 as a leisure craft. There are now 15 or 16 of them on the water. One such hooker, the Saint Patrick, built on Mweenish in 1906 and skippered by Paddy Barry, crossed the Atlantic in 1986, and has since gone to Greenland. She also sailed to other Arctic destinations including beyond the 80<sup>o</sup> latitude parallel off Spitzbergen in 1990. Saint Patrick slipped her mooring and sunk at Glandore in 2003… <em>may she rest in peace</em>. Paddy Barry went on to achieve even more fame by negotiating Canada’s North West Passage in 2003 and in 2004/2005 Siberia’s North East Passage, in each case in ‘Northabout’, the sailing craft specially designed and built for such purposes by Jarlath Cunnane of Dublin. Landing and Camping There are several working piers and quays, but the points of greatest interest to kayakers are the three beaches. The nicest is at L764-294 in the SW-facing elbow of the island, with good camping on machair in the dunes behind the beach, and good parking. This beach would be the best embarkation point for Mason – <em>Oileán Máisean</em> or MacDara’s Island – <em>Oileán Mhic Dara</em>. More reliably sheltered is the E-facing, smaller beach at L774-284, on the eastern side of the southern tip. Here, there is limited parking but excellent camping beside the ruin of a house at the southern end of the beach. Otherwise camping is impractical as the fields are stocked. There is a tide-dependent beach and a good flat grass area at the NE side opposite the bridge at L768-299.</p>\n",

Named <em>Cruach na Cara</em> on the OS 1:50,000 map, but nobody calls it that. It is uninhabited. 300 Barnacle Goose were found here in April 1994, but whether they were waystopping or wintering is not known. It is a place of annual pilgrimage on the 16<sup>th</sup> July every year. Saint MacDara is the patron saint of Galway Hookers, traditional sailing boats, which always dip their sails when passing the island. The church is of 12<sup>th</sup> Century construction. The roof fell in during the 19<sup>th</sup> Century and was restored in 1977.  An old graveyard became exposed in the big storms of January 2014. Landing and Camping Land at an attractive, sheltered, sandy beach on the eastern side below the church. There is excellent camping by the beach. There is another landing on the SE, S of the spit, on a pebble beach, necessary perhaps in easterly or north-easterly wind. Embarkation The best known launching point for Mason or MacDara’s is the beach in the SW-facing elbow of Mweenish Island at L764-294. Consider also Ard East pier, at the disused fish processing plant at L757-312, where endless parking. <strong>The Skerd Group – <em>Na Sceirde</em></strong> An impressive collection of rugged islets, lying 14<em>km</em> SSW of the entrance to Bertraghboy Bay. The whole is a network of rocks, bays, narrow channels, cuts, rocky reefs and small outlying rocks, though very much dominated by Skerdmore, which is bigger in area than one would at first expect, and is also highest at nearly 20<em>m</em>. Well worth the journey on a good day, these islets are said to have the greatest feeling of remoteness of all Irish offshore islands. As one approaches from the N, the combined mass appears to be one. In fact, the group consists of a cluster of high, rocky islands, separated by narrow channels. The channels divide the mass into blocks, mainly Skerdmore and Skerdbeg, each with outliers.  Skerdmore is by far the largest and highest block, to the SW of the middle channel, and Skerdbeg next biggest, to its NE. The OS sheet is less than accurate in this regard. The layout of the group is quite complicated. Skerdmore is rather horseshoe-shaped and faces E. Skerdbeg lies off the mouth made by its prongs, creating a reasonably sheltered interior embayment. There are rocks and hummocks lying off both islets, including a set that runs E/W from Skerdbeg towards the middle of Skerdmore, thereby dividing the interior embayment into two parts, N/ S of these rocks. The N part is accessible from the N, and the S part is much more easily entered from the S. The two parts of the embayment are joined by narrow channels through the rocks, the most navigable of which is towards the E side, but even this may not be passable from N to S at extreme LW, but some are easily so at other levels. Kayaking through the channels is quite possible in calm conditions but the entire area has an aura of danger, and is probably quite hazardous in swell. Embarkation The nearest launching point is 11<em>km</em> NW at the beach in the elbow of Mweenish Island at L764-294. It is also practical to set out from anywhere around Roundstone or the Bertraghboy Bay area generally, and perhaps break the journey at Croaghnakeela at L690-324.

Alternatively, it can be approached from several other mainland departure points in the Mace Head area. Illaunacroagh More is low lying overall and the rounded Connemara granite, boulder like erratics and rocky outcrops provide interest. The island is grazed by sheep and attractive to walk. The W side has extensive areas of rock slabs that, combined with the great views all round, give an exposed Atlantic experience to the walker. Landing is at an obvious cut along the E side onto rock slabs. There are the remains of a sheep pen just above the landing. A second possible landing point is onto a storm beach just S of the cut but this only possible at times of local HW.  It makes for an excellent days kayaking. No water found but camping is good.

Very pleasant feel and aspect to this island. The western side of the island is short cropped grass and very pleasant. The name <em>Fraoch Oileán</em> in Gaelic means ‘Heather Island’, probably the single most common name for an Irish offshore island. Uniquely among such islands, in this case the name is inappropriate, as no heather was found. The dominant vegetation is maritime variety of gorse that blooms in July/August. Plenty of sheep and 20 Snipe were flushed on short walkabout in January 2008.  Waders included Ringed Plover, Turnstone, Oystercatcher, Purple Sandpiper, Curlew and Redshank at lovely beaches. The small islet to SE held 50 Cormorant as a roost spot.  Common Gull were seen in summer 2006. No water either. Embarkation and Landing As for Inishbigger, embark from the car park in the centre of the beach at L746-339.

Inishlackan is distinguished from the land by a conspicuous, rectangular, water-tank structure on the highest point of the N side of the island. There is water in rain barrels outside most houses. Water used to be pumped by a windmill (now ruined) from a walled pond up to the nearby water storage tank. Formerly inhabited, it is now occasionally so in summer. The first summer dwelling was a restored schoolhouse in the NE corner above the harbour / beach. By 2005 there were up to half a dozen holiday homes, for that niche market. At least one of them was seriously well appointed, at the W end, complete with solar panels and well laikd out grounds. There is a large, shell-midden in sand hills at the NE corner of the island, by the schoolhouse. Inishlackan is a good stopover with easy access to the extremely pretty Roundstone village. Roundstone is a posh tourist centre, with pubs, restaurants, and some shops, but is poorly provisioned. It is the centre for intense tourist use of this stretch of mainland coast. The island is worth the visit. Landing and Embarkation Land in many places but it is best at a very sheltered pier with a sandy beach by the NE corner. There are rocky shores on almost all sides, with reefs offlying. Circumnavigation is iffiest at the SW corner. There is camping near the pier and elsewhere. The mainland embarkation is from a pier at Erlough at L717-386, in a bay about 1<em>km</em> to the N of the island, reached by taking the first left turn after the Garda Station as one leaves Roundstone for Ballyconneely.  Roundstone Pier and most of Roundstone were developed by Nimmo as a piece of private enterprise, one of a number of controversies that attached to the great man.</p>\n",

Now in 2008 there is a house and various outbuildings, probably including the two huts.  Solar panels on the boathouse beside the pontoon landing at the NE at L748-391 provide power, as does the wind generator up by the house to the SE, in the shelter of a mature stand of conifers.  With all the appearances of a summer-house only, there are modern additions, such as a sunroom. And land maintenance.  Paths have been cleared around the island for walking.   Planting has been aggressive, with well mature conifers arounf the house in the NE, and experimental trees such as eucalyptus, contorted pine, alder, sally, and even rhododendron (no kidding), Rhododendron Ponticum, a native to the Pontiac mountains. Ponticum is unusual among Rhododendrons in that it is lime tolerant. Almost all others prefer lower pH levels. Finest development of all is the tidal swimming pool in the SE, created by a simple garage, over which broods an ornamental elephant.  Full marks, daddy. The coast is rocky all around, but totally weed covered, so landings may be effected quite easily, downwind. <strong>Cashel Bay Islands</strong> A group of quite diverse islands are located in that part of the inner parts of Bertraghboy Bay, in or about the entrance to Cashel Bay. There is an inner Cashel bay and an outer Cashel bay.  The whole area is attractive especially if paddling from S/N, as there are great views of Cashel Hill and Twelve Bens, as well as a feeling of kayaking in close proximity to the mountains. <strong>Cashel Bay – Outer Islands</strong> The group of eight islands at outer Cashel Bay, in ENE Bertaghboy Bay, is dominated by the distinctive height of Croghnut Island. Most of these islands are flat and low lying, which seems to exaggerate the 30m summit of Croghnut. The island’s summit is a very useful navigation aid. All these islands have extensive areas inter-tidal zones that dry at LW, thus giving good circumstances for a variety of bird species, and Otter. Croghnut Island and Illauncroghnut to its N become joined at LW, as do Illaungorm North and South, so kayakers need to plan ahead to avoid embarrassment.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Illaungorm North</strong> L786-398           Sheet 44 A low-lying yet interesting island that marks the entrance from Bertraghboy Bay to Cashel Bay. The island is very attractive and has a number of interesting features. Landing Approached from the S the best landing is onto a lovely coral beach at a small spit in the extreme SW corner. This beach may well be best for landing as the tide drops but a narrow cut just north of spit also allows access. The cut is interesting in that is has remains of an old landing place, one of three found around the island. The unsightly wreck of gantries, pontoons and galvanised walkways from a ruined fish farm operation unfortunately mars the S shoreline. The second landing is at the site of the original village located in the NW of the island. The village has super views looking N to Cashel Hill and beyond into the Glencoaghan Horseshoe of the Twelve Bens. The houses are set close to the HW mark, reminiscent of those at Inishsherk.  The remains of a small quay/landing place are located here also. Just south of the largest ruined house the remains of an old boulder choked well was found.  It contained water in January 2008 but it was not certain if it is gravity or spring fed, so its reliability is not known.  In May 2008 it was judged unusable. A third landing area with three distinctive small jetties is located further E of the village along the N shore in small bay with a small ruin just S of the landing. The island’s only tree is an atmospheric wind shaped Hawthorn dominating the NE corner. On the S shore there are outcrops of old peat, which the sea has eroded to expose some very interesting examples of bog deal. The intertidal areas almost double the island’s size at LW and provide good feeding areas for duck and wading species and the presence of Otter was noted. There was no sign of recent grazing in January or May 2008 so the diversity of flora was rich. About LW, it is possible to walk to Illaungorm South. Best camping near village and at NW corner.</p>\n",

The island is different from the rest in the group due to its height difference. A mini “Sugarloaf” like hill dominates the centre of the island.  Its 30m summit contrasts with the other islands in the area. Croghnut is craggier than its immediate neighbours and is an attractive mixture of heather, scrub and grassland. There are remains of an old cottage or booley on a ledge above the E landing, tucked under the summit. The island has extensive areas of foreshore that become somewhat exposed at LW, and would appear to dry completely at its N point where it joins with Illaunacroghnut, its low lying but bigger sister. The summit has good views over the entire area, the island group and of the Twelve Bens. In winter, Curlew, Ringed Plover, Red-brested Merganser, Mallard &amp; Teal. Landing Landings can be found onto stony beaches on all sides of island but are best at the S / E sides at obvious cuts. Camping and water Camping is available at a number of sites, particularly at the S end.

It is about 7<em>km</em> E of Slyne Head and lies near Bunowen Bay and Aillebrack, a pretty holiday spot for the relatively wealthy. A number of attractive islets lie off the shore, largest of which is Illaunurra. Beware the notorious shallows hereabouts, which may leave you stranded on a falling tide. Also, boomers abound in conditions of even a little swell. Read Brian Wilson’s experience, as told in ‘Dances With Waves’, and be chastened. Embarkation and Landing Embark from the E-facing beach, sheltered by Bunowen Bay pier at L593-416, or just W of that from a pretty, W-facing strand at L585-417. The pier is probably the most logical embarkation place for rounding Slyne Head. There is a sandy beach with camping on the northern tip of the island, and several storm beaches. The landing place of choice must be a sheltered sand/storm beach at the SE. Immediately above it is manageable camping, greater privacy, and abundant firewood.

It is an unexpectedly large expanse of rock, with very sparse vegetation. Surprisingly, rabbits are living here, but must be the hungriest of their kind in Ireland. No camping. No water. A spit of stormbeach at the NE gives a soft enough landing. <strong>Connemara West</strong> <em>Conamara Thiar</em> <strong>Slyne Head to Killary Harbour</strong> <em>Ceann Léime go dtí an Chaol Sháile Rua</em> <strong>County Galway</strong> <strong>Slyne Head – <em>Ceann Léime</em></strong> Slyne Head is a major headland and divides the west coast of Galway and Mayo from Galway Bay. It is an island headland. Slyne Head is actually the W tip of Illaunamid, the outermost of a fragmented group of islands lying off the SW tip of Connemara. There are three main groups of these islands: Illaunamid, Chapel/Duck Island, and nearest the coast, Illaunaleama – <em>Oileán Léime</em> and Doonawaul – <em>Dún na bhFál</em>. The innermost and outermost sounds are unnamed. The much-fragmented gaps on the inside of Duck Island are Cromwell’s Sound, Blind Sound and Joyce’s Sound. Tim Robinson’s map of Connemara and/or Admiralty chart 2708 are recommended for the detailed navigation required in this area. The area consists of shallow reefs and islets surrounded by deep water and is exposed to Atlantic swell from all sides. The more interesting route W towards Illaunamid passes through the chain of islands. These are divided by sounds where strong tidal currents and overfalls occur, and are formidable in wind over tide conditions. The area between Chapel Island at L529-409 and Illaunamid at L514-412 is also dotted by reefs, and should be treated with caution, even in small swell. If there are frequent breakers on these reefs, landing at Illaunamid is likely to be difficult, if not impossible. However, if conditions permit, there is scope for exploring and playing in the tidal races outside Illaunaleama –<em>Oileán Léime</em> and Doonawaul – <em>Dún na bhFál</em>. Embarkation The nearest departure point is approximately 3<em>km</em> E on the Galway Bay side, in the bay opposite Connemara Golf Club, at the NW end of a long beach (<em>Trá Mhóir</em>) at L570-432. Parking may dictate a start further E at the totally dependable Bunowen Bay at L590-417. A trip N around the headland adds a certain interest and variation to the trip. The nearest alternative landing to the NE is at Stackport at L556-434, 1<em>km</em> NE of the coastal headland inside Slyne Head. This landing is a 1.5<em>km</em> road walk W from the <em>Trá Mhóir</em> put-in. Irish Lights used this quay for ferrying goods to the island, but the road is now through a series of gates, and may be private, so please ask for permission before taking your car down to the pier. The landing is difficult to see from seaward, but is close to two small houses. More dependable is Doonloughan at L569-453, but there is limited parking. Easiest perhaps on this side is at the head of Mannin Bay at L630-460, where the main road skirts the sea and there is plentiful parking.

        "description": "<p><strong>Illaunamid – <em>Oileán Imill</em></strong> L514-412           Sheet 44 This island is best known for its western headland, Slyne Head or <em>Ceann Léime</em>, and its lighthouse at L514-412. Illaunamid means ‘Wood Island’, because of the amount of flotsam washed up here. Robinson also terms it <em>Oileán Imill</em> (Edge/Margin Island), which Anglicises as Illaunimil. The most obvious feature of the island is the two lighthouses. Both were built in 1836. One is unused. The other flashes twice, every 15 seconds. For the story of these lighthouses and their people, read Bill Long’s excellent ‘Bright Light, White Water’. Tales include drowning tragedies during the building of the lighthouses, drowning of keepers, alleged murder of Irish Lights’ personnel on the island, shipwrecked sailors stealing boats and dismissal of keepers for drunkenness. Three big sets of solar panels are now connected into the lighthouse complex, along the southern wall. However, other features not mentioned in the book show that the keepers’ lives were not all misery. For instance, in the mid-90s, the remnants of a mini-golf course were to be seen, just to the S of the lighthouse. Alas, this is no longer evident. There is also an unusual model of a lighthouse, complete with crane, on a rock in a brackish pond. The elaborate model is the strangest sight here. It is N of the path between the lighthouse complex and the quay. It was refurbished in 2005. The model also has a small extra and easily missed feature – an outlying channel buoy in the extreme E end of the large pond. The effect of the relatively small model within the large pond/rock pool is quite realistic. The rock of the island is metamorphic (gneiss). The island is attractive with a remote feel to it. However, the impression of neglect and decay is strong around the unused lighthouse complex. The functioning lighthouse received a general clean up and was looking well in 2005. The quality of the building work in the network of houses and workrooms around the older lighthouse is impressive. Some of the fireplace mantles and capping stones are of beautifully worked granite. The assortment of debris and flotsam and jetsam, both around the lighthouse and on the storm beaches, does provide diversion for avid beachcombers. The island merits an overnight. Fauna Wildlife includes seals and rabbits. Breeding birds include Cormorant, Shag, Arctic Tern, Wheatear, Meadow &amp; Rock Pipit, Raven, Skylark, Oystercatcher and Ringed Plover. It is the best seabird and cetacean watching point in Galway. Some excellent work was done here by Davenport in 1979-1981 on spring Skua passage migration, but none appears to have been done on other species since. Pomarine Skua were spotted in nearby Ballyconneely Bay on the southern approaches in May 2003. Landing There are two landing areas, both of which are only dependable in low swell conditions. The first, and more reliable, is at a quay on the E end of the island at L518-410. It is easily spotted by a small pump-house and crane, formerly used to transfer fuel oil to the lighthouse. If the waves are too much at the quay, there is a small gully a few yards S. It leads to a small coral strand, more accessible on the top half of the tide. It is accessible at lower water, but only onto boulders. The gully is very narrow, admitting one kayak at a time. A less attractive alternative is a larger boulder beach on the N side of the quay. The second landing area is on the N side of the island, close to the W end and the lighthouse itself in a cove at L515-412. This small cove has the attractive name of <em>Fuaigh na gCaccanai</em> (Cove of the (Cormorant) Shite)! This landing is only reliable in calm conditions when all weather is coming from the S. There are steps cut in the stone towards the centre of the cove. On the W side there is a rock-choked passage topped by a concrete bridge leading to other steps. In both landing spots care must be taken to lift boats well clear of rogue waves and rising tide. Camping There are sheltered flat areas suitable for camping near the outbuildings of the older, disused lighthouse. The walk from the E landing to the lighthouse requires quite a bit of ferrying of gear. Camping is also available S of the E landing over the first hummock. Although not as protected as by the lighthouse, it is fine for reasonable weather conditions.</p>\n",

The 12<sup>th</sup> Century chapel founded by Saint Caillin at L531-410 itself is interesting, and boasts a collection teapot. In early 2003 there were no Euro coins yet evident, but in 2005 there were a few, probably indicating that not many pass this way. There is a lovely attractive bothy at a tidal lagoon on the S side, found in 2005 to have been done up. Chapel Island and Duck Island are separated by a narrow channel, open at all stages of the tide. The channel is easier found from the N. It passes immediately under the chapel. Landing The main landing on Chapel Island is on the south-western side at L528-408, almost facing Illaunamid. A landing may sometimes be had under the chapel, probably better at LW. Birds In March 2003, the following species were seen. An asterisk after the name indicates that they were probably breeding. There were seen 50+ Purple Sandpiper which is a nationally important number. There were also 40+ Oystercatcher<em>, 30+ Ringed Plover</em>, 10 Redshank, 1 Merlin, 6 Shelduck<em>, Raven, Skylark, Black Guillemot, Shag, and 20+ Swallow</em>. In March 2003, there were 40+ Grey Seal. At the same time on Chapel, 3 male and 1 female Eider were seen, and on nearby Horse Island another male, suggesting breeding. This would, if proven, be the southernmost outpost of breeding Eider on Ireland’s W coast as of summer 2003. The official such record is Inishkeeragh, Mayo. Eider are expanding southwards year by year, and it is thought that Mink disturbance is the cause.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Illaunaleama – Oileán na Léime</strong> L548-419           Sheet 44 Closest of all the group to the mainland, this is a beautiful island, only a narrow passage separating it from the mainland to the E. Sheep grazed and short grassed, even the rocks are scoured smooth, and no other Irish coastal island deems shoes more redundant. There is a very pleasant sandy beach facing E to the mainland, onto which land. There is also a storm beach landing on the W side, with a sheep pen above, a working environment. Camp pleasantly, but water was not found. <strong>Doonloughan Group</strong> Doonloughan is a beautiful mainland area of machair and beach, with a sprinkling of houses, about 7<em>km</em> NE of Slyne Head. The four islands described here are important as they create a sheltered inside channel. This is useful to know of in the context of a passage from Slyne Head to ManninBay to the NE, especially in any kind of wind conditions. The whole area outside the islands is strewn with dangerous booming reefs, and shallows of every kind. Here be dragons! Frightening waves tube, for a long way off, to great height and power, in almost any conditions. The middle channels entering this inner area on either side of Illaunamenara should also be avoided for the same reasons. The inside channel is impassable at lower water, when its two mainland piers are separated by 1<em>km</em> of sandflats.  Enter the channel from the SW Slyne Head side via the open bay inside Inishkeeragh, to a little quay at L569-453.  Enter from the NE Mannin Bay side via the sheltered deep-water channel inside Inishdugga, to a substantial and sheltered pier at L569-457.  Camping by either pier is excellent, but better at the latter.  No water found at either location, but ask at the houses. It is important if arriving at evening time to choose the campsite with open water available in the direction of travel the following morning. If necessary, wait to camp until the channels connect.</p>\n",

This tidal race at the mouth is almost entirely avoidable by those travelling in small boats, so access in or out of the bay is always possible. Spring tides converge with convenient, midday low tides, giving a good flow for a tour out of the bay and into Clifden Bay to the S, or Cleggan or Ballynakill Bays to the N. The most convenient put in point in upper Streamstown Bay is L636-532 near the head of the bay on the N side, over 1<em>km</em> from the main road, sheltered by a tiny spit of land that is almost an island, near a graveyard.  There is ample parking for all but very large groups. It is also possible to put in on the S side. This is beside the bridge at L640-525, 1<em>km</em> from the fork off the main road from Clifden to Letterfrack. The road is being widened hereabouts but it is still necessary to be considerate with the parking. Best feature of all in the bay is the paying campsite entered from the road on the N side of the bay at L588-548.  Long may it remain unsophisticated and welcoming, with its private beach at L587-547, safe for all, short cropped grass, and adequate if minimalist services.

A lake dominates the interior of the island. Many houses.  There is a ruined church and graveyard all smothered in sand, on the N side at L565-563. Human remains are visible which are being archeologically investigated by Dúchas. A lovely, worthwhile island not to be missed. Perhaps launch from Aughrusmore Pier to the NW of the island at L557-566.  Newly improved as of 2004, the pier now boasts a water tap, is much larger than before, and the parking is much better.  A beautiful spot in and of itself. Landing and Camping The inside passage at L575-562 dries mid-tide in the NE corner. Landings are possible along much of shore on the N and E sides on either side of the dry area. Also, at L573-551, there is an attractive small beach in a small cove just W of the SE corner. However, it is a bit exposed, and not very suitable for overnighting. No water. At L564-554 on the W side of the island, there is a sheltered beach in a deep bay, which is much better. There is excellent, remote, machair-type camping. There is water in a streamlet 500m NW of the beach, out of a pipe. 4 Corncrake were heard in 2003, 1 in 2010.</p>\n",

There is camping near the old, ruined, two-story house in which some shelter can be had for cooking. No water found. Farmed, cows and sheep, but lumpy, the island is attractive to explore. The story goes that when deciding where to draw the county boundary between County Mayo and County Galway, the ancient local Councillors threw a sack of oats into the ebbing tide as it spilled out of Killary Harbour. The islands that lay to the N of the oats as they floated out would be in Mayo, those to the S, in Galway. To the surprise of many, the oats floated down S of Crump and then headed out to sea. Hence, Crump is in Mayo. Editor’s Note: Crump is included with the W-facing Galway islands for convenience.</p>\n",

Circumnavigation and exploration in the occasional benign conditions is a spectacular experience. Landing The difficulty of landing sets High Island as a prize for all who aspire to come here. Midway along the SE side is a prominent cove, backed by huge cliffs under the highest part of the island. Landing is best about 200m E of this in a boulder choked cove. The back of the cove is shown on the OS sheet as having a ‘Cross Slab’. The landing cove is where the lower ground to the eastern end of the island begins to rise towards the centre, and where the island is narrowest and most waisted. Kayaks may well land in calm conditions onto the boulders and scramble airily to the plateau above. On the E side of the cove is a hard-rock landing for boats, at which surge is limited and the scramble to the plateau above is much easier. There is a ring for a shoreline, much improved as of 2010, and an out-haul anchor is recommended. Kayakers might consider landing even one boat at this spot, in case conditions deteriorate while ashore. Above the landings beware the opening to an old mineshaft – quite apparent in good conditions, but dangerous for the unwary. There is a second landing point reported, just E of the SW tip of the island at L503-571. Clinker boats might manage better here, but it is a bit exposed for kayaks. If manageable, it is closer to the monastic ruins on the island and might thus be preferred by some. It is directly underneath the smaller of the two island lakes. Camp at will. Water in the lakes appears stagnant but looks better in the streamlets E of centre. High Island is uninhabited. It was once owned by Brian Boru, and more recently by Richard Murphy, the poet. There is a (Murphy) stone hut, and a more recent timber Dúchas building. Rumours abound of a ruined copper mine on the eastern slopes near the high point of the island, and of an awesome cavern-like cave on the north-western side. There are the ancient 7th Century ruins of an early Christian beehive hut, monastery and chapel, said to have been founded by Saint Feichin of Omey Island fame. The ruins are beside the larger of two lakes above the western end. In 2003, these are being refurbished by Dúchas. Raised platforms and planks protect the excavations from workers’ muddy boots. There are three impressive inscribed slabs at the back of the chapel, worth finding. SPA Peregrine, Chough, Storm &amp; Leach’s Petrel, Barnacle Goose. In 2003, there were Raven, Twite, Black Guillemot, Skylark and Meadow Pipit.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishshark  <em>Inis Airc</em></strong> L501-640           Sheet 37 The name means ‘Sea Monster Island’. A splendid, formerly-inhabited island. There is an abandoned school, but no modern church. The pier was built in 1937 by Michael O’Sullivan of Ballycastlebeg in Cork, according to a commemorative stone nearby. The islanders in living memory went to Inishbofin of a Sunday for mass.  Expert natural meteorologists, on 28<sup>th</sup> October 1927 they saw the front coming that caused devastation to fishermen up and down the west coast, depopulating the Inishkeas.  They had no way to warn anyone and Shark, alone of ALL THE ISLANDS, lost not a single man.  There were 26 families in 1893, but the population dwindled, and the last left in October 1960, mainly for the mainland nearby. The island is rugged yet pretty. Birds The island is home to 70 or 80 Barnacle Goose each winter. Bonxie also breed here. There is an interesting, small burial ground at the harbour and a small derelict 19<sup>th</sup> Century chapel, which is called St. Leo’s, after the patron saint of the island. The church had a bell, which broke and fragmented, and it was believed that to bring any part of it on a journey would bring good luck. Emigration being what it was in the middle part of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century, North America is thought to be littered with carefully kept and much honoured little bits of the bell. Inishshark lies WSW of and is separated from Inishbofin by Ship Sound. The island has large cliffs and sea stacks on the western side. Big breakers and reflecting waves are the norm out the back of the island, providing an interesting and committing circumnavigation. The crossing of Ship Sound can be treacherous with contrary winds and many shallows, which may boom. Landing and Camping The traditional landing is inside a protective but otherwise unusable pier below the abandoned village on the E end of the S coast. The landing is onto a steep slipway or stony storm beach beside the slipway. Alternatively, use a very narrow cut providing a dependable soft landing about 100m E of the pier. The camping is excellent. The water in the well looks a little dodgy. There is also a fine landing located at the SE tip of the island L503-643 that can be missed quite easily by kayakers making direct to the old pier and slipway. A distinctive square shaped hummock on the shoreline is a useful marker to guide in those looking for this landing. There are two narrow cuts leading to a lovely hidden sandy beach. The most northerly of the two cuts is the better for landings as a boulder partially blocks the more southern one. The camping above this landing is very good and water can be found in the obvious little valley than runs away uphill. This may require a pool to be dug below the boulder area on the beach but the water quality was good in August 2010. A pair of territorial Great Skuas was actively defending two well fledged young on the NW side in August 2010</p>\n",

Two white towers on the island face the entrance to the main harbour, on a bearing of 032<sup>o</sup> (true), and lead in through the safest entry point. The entrance can boom in heavy swell to either side of the best route. The best landing for small craft is on a slipway beside the old pier further into the bay than the new pier, or a shingle beach behind it. In emergency or on circumnavigation, there are landings on every side of the island, but fewest in the N. Circumnavigation Watch for <em>Dun Na hInine</em> (Daughter’s Fort), an almost detached stack at the NW point. Otherwise, the circumnavigation is interesting if undramatic by local standards. The most turbulence may be expected at Ship Sound and around the Stags of Bofin in the NW at L505-670. Camping There is good camping with easy landing and privacy at L537-644. This is by the ruined fort at the harbour mouth, opposite the village. Access to the village area is then easiest by sea.  The pleasant 10 minutes walk around is also entirely manageable, certainly worth it for the quality of the camp spot. Any campsite on the (convenient) village side of the main harbour will lack privacy.  Minor warnings are that noise late at night from outside the pubs across the water may bother, and camping too near the fort means you could be cut off by the tide.  <em>Caveat camptor</em>. For a longer stay, camping is undoubtedly best made around at the eastern end of the island, in the horseshoe shaped bay, which has a very pretty beach for a nice soft landing, very sheltered, but a bit public. The end of the beach where Inishlyon meets Inishbofin used to be popular but is no longer allowed. Coastal erosion defence measures are being put in place in the form of newly planted Marram grass. This landing spot necessitates a long walk to camp or stay at Day’s Hostel at L543-653 (095 45855), not to mention the pub and the good shop. Corncrake Inishbofin was always a Corncrake stronghold, but there were only 14 recorded in 1988. By 1994, there were none. The good news is that 5 were serenading in 2003, and 3 in 2010.</p>\n",

Incredibly, people lived here until the 1940s. It lies a couple of kilometres directly outside the mouth of Killary Harbour. The island is privately owned and particular care should be taken to leave absolutely no litter, to ensure continued use for all. Sheep, Peregrine, Terns.  Well worth a stopover, and a good waystop on an inner coastal tour to avoid the exposed beaches under Mweelrea Mountain. Landing The main landing place is onto a gravely beach in a cove on the NE side, under ruined houses. Camping is at the houses, with water in a well behind the middle ruin, which may or may not be drinkable. Approach this landing via the main channel through the group. There is also a storm beach just SW of the northern tip. Because this spot is joined by a half-tide reef to outlier Cooneenfadda, landing is always possible.  The camping hereabouts is more openly attractive, and certainly the unlimited driftwood is an attraction to those who would be sociable round their bonfires in the night. There are other landings, onto boulders on the W side in a creek, and more easily on the S side but the camping isn’t great.</p>\n",

It is about 500m long, with an extensive area of drying rocks to the SE.  The island was sheep grazed upo to the 1980s, but no more. The island is privately owned and particular care should be taken to leave absolutely no litter, to ensure continued use for all. Landing The forced deep water landing, in moderate conditions, is at the ESE tip.  What is a channel at HW becomes a narrow lagoon sheltered by higher drying rocks on the bottom half of the tide. Entrance to the lagoon from either side is via a narrow gap. The N opening is always there but is not visible until very close.  The S opening more or less disappears at LW, leaving the lagoon often very calm.  Access up the rocks is easy and direct. Frehill would be acceptable as a waystop in calm conditions, or an emergency stop in less favourable conditions, but only on the lower half of the tide. Far preferable for waystop or emergency is Inishdegil. The ground to the N and NW outside Frehill towards Caher Island is shallow and breaks in wind. This inshore passage between Killary and Roonah is strictly for good weather only. In any kind of W swell, there are many breakers around the island. If paddling past, it’s best to keep close to the N-facing shore. Particular attention should be paid to Carrick McHugh, a rock 3 cables N of the island.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishturk</strong> L619-749           Sheet 37 This is one of the most rugged and remote of all the inhabited islands. There were once up to 180 people resident, and now there are 62. The local national school has only 3 pupils in 2001/2012.  The island children have always gone away to secondary school as teenagers. This is one of the most rugged and remote of all the inhabited islands off the W coast. Until recently, there was no regular ferry, but long overdue perhaps, Inishturk got a new ferry on September 16<sup>th</sup> 1997. This is probably the most significant ‘Irish offshore island development’ for many years, and it’s hoped that the needs of islands and islanders are at last being taken seriously. Operating out of Cleggan and Roonah Quay, this ferry also has a real significance for kayakers, as the homeward trip becomes possible even if the weather kicks up overnight. Those who sail small boats off the W coast of Ireland must occasionally expect to fail to be behind their desks of a Monday morning. Inishturk is now a marginally more dependable objective. We wish the islanders well and hope that all this won’t change things for them, other than as they would wish. There are fantastic high cliffs at the back of the island. The western side of the island can cut up very rough and care should be taken to avoid breakers up to 100m W of the cliffs. In mirror-calm conditions or offshore easterly winds, the back of the island has huge cliffs to explore. Care should also be taken at the N of the island where fierce downdraughts can be experienced beneath the two high points. There are B&amp;Bs, pubs, and basic shops. There is a splendid circular roadway to walk. This goes inland, up the valley from the harbour, and back anti-clockwise by the southern side. Generally, the walking on the island is very good. The N and W are dramatically cliffy. Near the NE tip is a blowhole, the seaward end of which emerges through a penetrable boulder-choke, giving a scuba dive of great quality. Corncrake Formerly a Corncrake stronghold, there were 26 pairs counted in 1988. Paddlers heard at least one in 1992, but they were all gone by 1994. Landing The landing place is in the main village and harbour (by Nimmo) on the E side, which has recently been extended and is very sheltered. Also, landing is possible at beaches just S of the main harbour, if necessary. Off the mouth of the harbour is a bar, which can give a sporting arrival or departure. But the water inside or outside the bar is well sheltered. In the Great War, the Royal Navy favoured this as an anchorage. Portdoon          L607-737 A narrow cut in rocks yields a superbly sheltered natural harbour, halfway along the southern coast. Camping is easy, but it is a good walk to the pub.</p>\n",

On the SE of the island is a brackish lake and on the NW high point is a well – St. Patrick’s Well. The island is uninhabited and ‘belongs’ to Inishturk, the people of which have the commonage grazing here. There is a fine 5<sup>th</sup> Century monastic ruin and crosses, close to the landing, which are used for the annual pilgrimage to and ‘pattern’ on the island. A pattern is an ancient rural Irish Catholic prayer tradition. A circular wall 1.5m high and 20m in diameter, now broken in places, forms a “cashel”. Inside is a wee oratory. The island is the alleged resting place of Saint Patrick. His bed is outside the oratory, a flat stone half covered in mud and grass. The ‘floating’ stone is still there in the oratory, and will always return to the island, even if stolen. There is also an ancient prayer/wishing bowl. Unfortunately, some holy stones seem to have gone missing in recent years.  The altar stone depicted in Oileáin behind the monies offerings platter was not there in 2008. And beware the thief, whose boat will sink. Some work has been done to re-create the Stations of the Cross and a new “old” one is now visible on the ground behind the E wall of church. The monks lived in terror of the Vikings from 800 or so to about 1,000. By 1,500 they had Algerine slavers to worry about. All the while they starved in winter. Their faith must have been enduring. Landing and Camping Land on the SE, or at Port Temple in a shallow bay below the ruins of the church, just NW of the eastern tip. There is another, in some ways better, landing on the SW side. It is difficult to find until very close, and consists of a narrow inlet, which turns to the right after a few metres. The land just opposite is probably the best for camping. The holy well is unsuitable for drinking water. Bird life Bonxie breeding. Lovely island.</p>\n",

There are almost continuous breaking swells over a long rock ledge running out W from the pier. This is the embarkation place for the ferry to Clare Island, with waiting room, public phone, and toilets nearby. Roonah is a corncrake stronghold. Launching is difficult, from the steps or a boulder beach adjacent. In northerlies, a better spot for small groups is the N end of sandy White Strand beach just S of Emlagh Point at L747-797, about 1<em>km</em> to the S, reachable easily by road from Roonah. Larger groups will prefer the S end of the beach at L748-788.  More dependable, but less convenient, on the Clew Bay side is the sand-silted Carrowmore Pier at L794-817.

There is a regular ferry service <a href=\"http://www.clareislandferry.com/\">www.clareislandferry.com</a> from Roonah Quay at L744-808. Hire bikes or bring your own.  The population of the island is about 150 in winter, and double that in summer. There are several B&amp;Bs. Basic provisions are available and there are limited facilities – a pub, hotel, public phone and even a nurse. There is a new hostel <a href=\"http://www.goexplorehostel.ie/\">www.goexplorehostel.ie</a>, with bar and fish restaurant, the fish caught daily by the manager. There is a “no booze inwards” policy here as elsewhere, and any drinking must be done at the bar. The island is well worth a special visit. It is the highest of the truly offshore islands of Ireland. Knockmore at 462m gives spectacular views of the Mayo coast and falls almost sheer to the sea. Corncrake have not been heard since 1988 except for a single calling bird in 2002. Landing and Camping Land by the recently much extended and improved pier at L715-852 by the main harbour near the SE tip. The pier is just by an old, square castle, being one-time HQ of pirate-queen Granuaile who ruled the western seaboard. Camping is in the campsite in the field behind the beach. There is a small charge for this facility and it includes access to the toilets in the community centre just across the road. If utilising the camp site it makes more sense to land on the beach rather than the pier. L693-843        This is a significant landing on a gravel beach beside a broken pier. It is about halfway along the S coast at Portnakilly. It is not apparent until close and is situated below a conspicuous church and ruined 12<sup>th</sup> Century Abbey. This has been recently restored. It is early Cistercian, pre-Norman, pre-English and pre-Granuaile. There is a well-stocked Coop shop, but it is a long way to the pub at the harbour. L703-877        Near the northern tip of the island, landing is also possible on the north-eastern side, about 1<em>km</em> SE of the tip, in a well-sheltered cove. Unfortunately this cove is not dependable as swell can make landing very difficult, but it is worth a look. The cove is about halfway between a prominent boulder beach and the disused but conspicuous lighthouse on the northern point of the island. Landing is onto a steep slip, or onto a sheltered breakwater. This landing is of interest on circumnavigation, or for its green road giving convenient access to the interior. Space for boats at the landing is limited.  Larger groups should consider leaving tethered boats floating on the water. Circumnavigation A circumnavigation is a memorable experience, but a serious undertaking. There are long sections without reliable landings, particularly from Portnakilly on the southern side, all the way through the SW and N to the landing spot on the NE. There is an inlet on the southern side of the island, 1<em>km</em> E of the south-western tip. Locally called Lackwee, it is exposed to the SW but otherwise sheltered.  There is always strong tidal effects at the N, E &amp; SW points. Rock Climbing The first rock climbing on the island was pioneered by Gerry Moss in 2013 at L665-843 about 5km from the pier along the south shore. Tides Tides flooding into Clew Bay flow east on the northern side of the island and northeast on the southern side.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>North of Clare Island</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">E</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:30 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">0.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">W</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">0:40 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>South of Clare Island</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">NE</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:30 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">SW</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">0:40 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">0.5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The ground on the southern side is shallow. Both passages, particularly the northern side, kick up when the ebb is against the prevailing westerlies. If on passage north, catching the flood combines well with the tides into and through Achill Sound, but care is needed on passage south. Flora and Fauna Robert Lloyd Praeger the greatest ever Irish naturalist, organised probably the greatest ever survey of a particular area ever conducted in Ireland. From 1909 to 1911, 100 scientists from all over Europe put Clare Island under the microscope. Once again (Praeger had gone this way on the less remote Lambay Island off Dublin a few years before), they found no new Galapagos, where species change and adapt in a remote environment over time. They did though recognise 9,000 organisms overall, including 109 animals and 11 plants new to science. Granuaile In the 16<sup>th</sup> century, Grace O’Malley – <em>Gránúaile</em> – sea-queen of western Ireland, was based here at Clare. Her castle dominates the landing at the pier in the quiet bay on the E side. The O’Malley motto was “invincible on land and on sea”. <em>Gránúaile</em> took that seriously. She tolled every ship that came her way, Irish or not. Famously, she sailed to London to visit the queen, Elizabeth. She was well received. She offered her “tolling” services to the British, in what sounds like a somewhat mercenary arrangement. She used and abused her femininity and particularly her husbands – she had three – to gain territory and advantage generally.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>The Islands of Clew Bay</strong> L935-863           Sheet 31 The islands of Clew Bay are very accessible, and provide an highly attractive option for visiting paddlers, whether or not suffering bad weather. Essentially, these islands are the most W tip of Ireland’s ‘drumlin belt’, the other end being at Strangford Lough, S of Belfast.  Drumlins are the remnants of lateral moraines left behind by the last ice age, boulder clay and gravel covered with soil and grass.  The belt wanders through Down, Armagh, and Cavan, and then meanders ever westwards, disappearing into the sea at Clew Bay. The islands, just as in Strangford, tend to be grazed, grassy hummocks. These islands are pretty and in the prettiest of locations. They are sandwiched between the mighty cone shaped Croagh Patrick to the S and the Nephins to the N. Croagh Patrick is a holy mountain with a chapel on the summit.  Known all over as ‘the Reek’, a reek is a haycock, or also a stack of turf. The Nephins are probably the remotest and wildest mainland hills in Ireland. It is widely believed in Ireland that there are 365 islands in inner Clew Bay, ‘one for every day of the year’.  Pilgrims climbing Croagh Patrick get their chance to count them, but must be distracted, as in reality there are slightly less than 100. About 55 are dealt with in this text as of 2012. The barefoot walk to the summit, on the last Sunday of July, is an annual test for the hardier of local Christians.  In kayaking terms there are half a dozen islands that stand out, a dozen highly attractive, another dozen nice, and the rest, well they are grand altogether.  Quality, in terms of the visiting recreationalist with a day or days to spend, peaks along the W outer rim, and even at that is better in the S half.  Inishoo midway is generally regarded as the jewel in the crown, while Innishcannon just to its N is the pretty unattractive. In June 2012, only some of the islands were inhabited, and no water was found on any uninhabited ones. There is probably a connection. Collan More, and Island More / Knocky Cahillaun are the largest. All inhabited islands had been given piers and/or pontoons about 10 years ago, and most had mains water and electricity even before that.  Inishlyre had the largest population at 6.  Collan More, with a permanent population of 2, has the famous Glenans Sailing Centre, capable of over 50 students at a time. Inishgowla South had 2.  Inishgort with 1 has a lighthouse. John Lennon bought Dorinish in 1969 and a commune thrived there for a while. It is said locally that he preferred the hotels of Westport and Mularanny, accessing the commune by day by helicopter.  The commune survived in tents. Many of the islands are interconnected by reefs at lower tides, and many others are almost so, making seagoing journeys amongst them less trouble on the top half of the tide. Reefs / gravel bars sometimes differ from OS (understandably). For instance Inishgort to Islandmore dries at mid tide, while Islandmore, Rabbit Island, Derrinish and Inishbee are more or less permenently connected.  The big worry is being caught on a falling tide, unable to float out of trouble.  Realistically, the <em>portage</em> is a necessary part of the sea kayaker’s skills hereabouts, so factor it into the trip planning. A different island may be chosen each night. Beware that navigation needs careful map reading and getting lost is more than possible, necessitating landing and a stroll to the nearest summit to reorientate. There are a few derelict crofts.  The local mudwall division of fields will interest the many for its labour intensive character.  Marvel at the lazybeds, the term used to describe famine time potato growing activity.  There was nothing lazy about those who grew potatoes this way or subsisted on potatoes any way.  On some islands lazybeds cover every green inch. Regrettably, the islands are divided W/E between sheets 30 / 31, truly a pity. Categorisation The islands of the bay may loosely be divided into three categories for the visitor.  The outer islands, particularly in the middle/S, are remote and wonderful and invite camping overnight.  Inside these the islands tend to be farmed, but the more remote tend to be absentee farmed.  That means sheep but not cattle, so these are also a joy to walk, mostly unfenced, the views are stunning, and camping is normally perfectly possible.  Nearer the shore the islands may be inhabited or farmed as though on the mainland, so greater respect for the privacy of the owner is required, especially where there is one house only on an island. While walking is a pleasure, on occasions strictly with permission, camping would normally be out. Flora &amp; Fauna Black Guillemot, waders, Grey Wagtails, and all the usual bird and plant life abound. A single Corncrake was heard in 2001.  There are no rabbits.  Several islands in the NE were rat infested in 2012.  Seals are few and localised.  Some signs of otter.  Foxes reside. Damson trees are frequent in the NE, so roll on September. Tides There is no committed or exposed paddling.  Beachcombing on low tides is a must, especially where a stormbeach joins two islands in a natural catchment setup.   Slack water corresponds closely to HW and LW Westport, which is about Galway +0030. Beware of the tidal race on the ebb at the Inishgort lighthouse at L900-876. There are 3<em>kn</em>+ races through gaps between Bartra, Inishdaugh and Dorinish, and similar but weaker (approx 1.5<em>kn</em>) N &amp; S of Inishoo. Flows are also significant in Newport Channel and S of Inishbearna. Beware of localised wind –v- tide. Care should be taken in the N side of bay, especially off the Rosturk strand area, for risk of stranding on sandflats as the tide recedes. Access Access is from anywhere near Westport or Newport, but for the middle section of the bay perhaps nowhere more central or convenient than the pier at Rosmoney Quay L935-873.  From Westport, head N on the N59, and when barely out of the town, turn left at a sign for rugby, golf and Glenans Sailing Club. Follow the small road to the the sailing club and park at the pier. There is a stand-pipe for fresh water and easy slipway access.  Roscahill Pier L942-885 on Castlelaffey strand is also convenient and is more sheltered in N winds, but to be avoided at LW springs.  It is adjacent to a castle associated with Graineuaile’s most famous seafaring son <em>Tibod Na Long</em>. There are significant tidal streams on both ebb and flood through entrance channel. The road crossing this channel on the OS doesn’t exist. The Carraholly area may also be considered for the very S/SE area near Westport, called Westport Bay.  The best put-in is Pigeon Point L953-850 – park sensitively as the shellfish factory is operational, and remember that trucks need room to turn. There is a huge harbour seal colony just off here.  This is also the site of the Achill islanders tragedy when 34 migrant workers from Achill waiting to go on board the Elm, a steamship bound for Scotland. Access is poorer towards the N, and certainly there is nothing readily suggestive for the NW outer islands.  Even Mulranny pier L833-957 may be considered in this regard.  Elsewhere along this N side of the bay, the carry to LW may be offputting.  For small parties there is a feasible option at L868-958 Rosturk Strand, just down a short boreen from the main road.  Here the rising tide reaches earlier than elsewhere, but the parking is limited, very much so at spring tides. To the N inner islands, in Newport Bay, access is best from Newport Marina [Gridref] (at the apartments themselves, formerly a seaweed factory) – or – the newly renovated and extended pier at Carrigahowley / Rockfleet L923-952, well sheltered and adjacent to the excellently restored Rockfleet castle.  This is associated with Grainneuaile’s second husband, Richard “Iron Dick” Burke, who acquired his name from his habit of always wearing armour, from which he made his fortune. At HWS it is possible to paddle right up to the castle door. Access sadly has been prohibited in 2010 by the OPW in fear of litigious entrants. Pedalling / Paddling Planning The Westport – Achill Sound railway, closed in 1937, has now been converted to an excellent 42<em>km</em> cycle route, making a great option for a combined paddle / cycle trip.  Opening spring 2011 all the way. Main Channel into inner Westport The main channel from seaward into Westport passes immediately S of Inishgort lighthouse, and swings S, passing SW of Inishlyre, continuing between Inishlaghan and Inishimmel.  Now head ESE (actually 127<sup>o</sup>, SW edge Inishlyre on Inishgort lighthouse), pass between Inishraher and Inishgowla South, then keep Finaun and Green Islands to left, the little Corillan and Carricknamore to right.  Once into inner Westport Bay the channel towards Westport is called Westport Channel, which passes S of Monkellys Rocks, and is a excellently buoyed all the way in to L973-847. Follow the channel along the old quay, until a handy slipway at the gates of Westport House L981-846, where parking is reasonable in the area, and all modern facilities nearby. Best approached at mid-tide or above.  Do explore the fine old boathouse of Westport House, opposite the quay. Do not under any circumstances deviate towards Westport Quay to the ESE L978-843. From Close inshore the S part of Clew bay, a passage is perfectly possible just off Bartraw, inside Inishdaugh.</p>\n",

Approaching from the sea to eastward, the ridges of the lazybeds are so prominent that this one factor bears in strongly.  Landing on the extreme SW corner at LW one is struck immediately by the distinctive “drumlinesque” twin summits and the cropped off W sides eroded glacial till slopes. These two islands are separated by a raised storm beach that catches all the flotsam that passes nearby.  Extensive spit to NE.  Land at a beautiful sandy beach in the SE of the N island Mor.  Larger in every way than Beg, Dorinish Mor has possibly the highest boulder clay cliff in the world. Here boasted the famous Beatles commune of the late 60s, post Woodstock era.  Promoted by John Lennon, he and Yoko Ono occasionally came 1970 – 1972, and there was even a visit from Princess Grace and Prince Ranier.  The commune was directed by the “King of the Hippies” Sid Rawle, who retains that title to today.  It all began with a summer camp in July August, but an overwinter was tried.  Banks surrounded every construction, anti-wind.  Mostly they lived in teepees but the king had a wooden structure.  At the height of its experience, tomatoes were growing under plastic, but the wind won out in the end.  There are also the remnants of three crofts just NE of the beach, with kitchen gardens still obvious. Lennon’s music came under various regional influences during his lifetime, mostly from the far east.  Why not from the west?  Imagine Matt Molloy on the zitar and John on the uileann pipes.  Maybe both would have benifitted? Fauna Sheep, no cattle, Merganser, Lapwing, lots of breeding Cormorant.</p>\n",

The centre was built in 1979, and though originally a French outfit, it is now entirely Irish run.  Parties of 50+ can stay at Glenans.  Two people live permanently in the centre.  The summit is just above the centre to its N. About 3 other houses are not permanently occupied, including a renovated schoolhouse to the NE.  Absentee farmed.  Little attractive camping found.

The centre is at the gap with Knocky Cahillaun where there are half a dozen houses.  A laneway though the gap is an important thoroughfare hereabouts, certainly a significant <em>portage</em> in an area where these things matter.  The houses are well appointed, money no object.  The ridge walking either side of the gap is gorgeous.  Rabbit L902-897 is also joined to Inishbee / Derinish, and nowadays is an absentee cattle ranch.  There is also a posh quay / pontoon on the spit joining to Quinnsheen Island at about L909-891. Most remarkable is the fine path created from the pontoon to the nearest house, across unstable storm beach.  The house is old, with old vegetation, there a long time. Even more so, view the Steamship wrecked in Island More Harbour, called the  <em>Charles Stewart Parnell</em>. She caught fire while at anchor there, and was lost with no casualties. She is famous for the enormous lobster living in her boiler, who has been trapped there the last 30+ years, as it grew too big to escape!</p>\n",

There is a sandy LW beach at the NNE in a small bay.  Good camping is on short grass on the E side of the bay. <strong>Achill Island Area</strong> Achill (14,672ha) is the biggest and most populous Irish island with 2,500 full-time residents. It is connected to the mainland by a swivel bridge at Achill Sound, built 1888. ‘L’ shaped, high mountains mark the scenery all along the SW side. Only in the far NE corner is there flat land. At Keel, there is a substantial machair, and behind it is the most populated part of the island where there are pubs, restaurants, and all amenities. Two-thirds of the way down the W side is Dooega, a sheltered harbour, and at the S tip lies Achill’s little sister Achillbeg, a wonderful island. The E shore on the edge of Achill Sound is low and boggy. Near the S end of the sound is a Granuaile castle worth visiting. The RNLI station is close by. Midway up the sound is the bridge at the village of Achill Sound, where there are all facilities. On the N coast is the hamlet of Doogort, under Slievemore Mountain, with its beautiful beach and pier, backed by machair. During the famine era of the mid 19<sup>th</sup> Century, Edward Nangle ran the most energetic Protestant ministry ever experienced in Ireland. Generally, the various Christian churches in Ireland do not proactively proselytise (convert) each other’s members. Nangle went in hard and succeeded to a degree, but at a price. He opened schools and even a hotel. He stands critically judged by history in that he only offered food to the hungry who would become Protestant. Those accepting this bribe were called ‘soupers’, a pejorative term all over Ireland to this day. He also operated on Inishbiggle. Paul Henry (1876 – 1958) the noted Belfast landscape artist spent years on Achill and some of his best works were painted here – Launching the Currach, Potato Diggers, and Granuaile’s Castle.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Achillbeg Island</strong> L720-924           Sheet 30 Thought by many to be among the finest of formerly inhabited islands off Ireland, a worthy rival to the Blaskets and the Inishkeas. Attractive. A fertile valley links two ice rounded hills to N and S, schist to the N and sandstone to the S. There is a row of cottages on the N slope of the valley and a disused schoolhouse on the S side. Of the 326 total acreage, there are 80 arable acres and 200 acres grazing. Geological evidence suggests the island was once joined to the mainland to the NE.  Sociological evidence suggests it was joined to Achill to the NW until much more recent times.  Ancient maps show similar townland and other place names shared with Achill and the mainland. More intriguingly, an old fort <em>Dún na gCurrach</em> (Dun Gurrough) L708-931 (with nearby <em>Dún Beag</em>) at the NW tip surely guarded the SE end of what must have been a narrow strip of land providing a NW passage between the two islands before the sea broke through. In the mid 1800s there was said to have been 200 people on the island, but the population was never more than 117 in the 1900s. There were 104 in 1900, and this was down to 67 in 1936 when the remaining people resisted evacuation and resettlement on Achill. Specifically in 1959, there were 8 pupils in the school, all brothers and sisters. The last 38 people all left during the 1960s. The island missed the worst of the blight that gave the Great famine of 1847. Edward Nangle hte missionary visited but did not proselytise here.  There was once poor turf in the NW but by 1880 or so all turf was brought in from Saula through Achill Sound, back breaking and dangerous work. Formerly Irish speaking, the island was entirely bilingual by 1900. The crossing of Achill Sound to the E of the island and Blind Sound to the N are often treacherous as both are exposed. Rabbits, plentiful on the mainland nearby, never made it here, though hares and foxes were plentiful. Rats invaded twice in living memory but the islanders trapped them and prevented a colony forming.  Badgers established themselves just before the islanders left. Stoats and hedgehogs were very occasionally seen, and mice only towards the very end. <em>Dún Chill Mór</em> a forked headland on the W side, is a triple fort with the outer, E, section at L709-926. The two inner citadels are on the two branches at L707-926 and L707-927. <em>Dún Chill Mór</em> (Dun Kilmore) is said to be the most elaborate promontory fort of the W Coast. It was started in the early Iron Age, and was inhabited by many cultures over a long period up to early Christian times. It is somewhat dilapidated through incessant Atlantic assault. Find it by walking W along the N side of the waist, past a storm beach and under a cliff, until the forked headland is identified. There are some remarkably attractive (70m) rock climbing cliffs at L714-922, though N-facing. Note also the early summer Mediterranean Heath (<em>Erica</em>). Landing The best landing is at a lovely sheltered sandy beach midway on the E side L720-924 called locally <em>Trabóderig</em> (the strand of the red cow). Landing is also possible on the NE side, but less easily. There is a new pier and steps 500m to the S of the main landing beach at L722-920 which provides deep water access to Achillbeg always, but is of little interest to very small craft. Camping. A “No camping” sign appeared at the main E facing beach in 2010.  It is understood though that kayakers in small numbers who enquire locally will be facilitated. There are also some storm beaches on the outside (W) of the island for those who favour the oceanic feel to their camping. Tides See below for tidal information for the southern entrance to Achill Sound.

        "description": "<p><strong>Bills Rocks</strong> L551-938           Sheet 30 The Bills Rocks lie 11<em>km</em> due S of Keem Strand (F562-043) on Achill Island. Keem is pronounced ‘Kim’ locally. This is the nearest launching point for a trip to the Bills. Larger groups might prefer Gubalennaun Beg quay at F623-036 (locally “Purteen”) where there is easy parking and no surf. This option adds 1<em>km</em> to each leg of the trip. The Bills comprise three large, steep-sided, grass-covered rocks. The largest rock has a grass covering of approximately half a soccer pitch. The ground is relatively level and could be camped upon, but it is completely exposed and it would probably be foolhardy unless you were sure of settled weather. Landing It is possible to land on the largest rock, which is the most northerly. On the southern side is a long, sloping cliff to the top. The gradient here is approximately 50º and while it might be easy for a rock climber, it could be quite challenging in canoeing gear or wet weather. The landing should only be attempted in calm weather and is best at LW, when there is an obvious ledge approximately 2m above water level, which can be accessed by a large, ‘easy to climb’ crack. It would be prudent to have a light kayak for this endeavour. There is probably only enough room for three kayaks on the ledge, which limits the size of the landing party. Kayaks can be left on the ledge and tied to the rock face using rock-climbing chocks. From the ledge, a large fissure runs diagonally from bottom left to top right and the top of the rock face. There are obvious handholds along the crack and it would probably be graded a ‘diff’ in old rock climbing parlance. If you have the skills, the climb is worth it. At the top, you really feel exposed, miles from anywhere on a rock in the sea. It is an airy feeling. There are great views back up to Achill while to the SE, the exposed western coasts of Clare Island, Inishturk and Inishbofin are visible. The trip is a brilliant day paddle. It is worth circumnavigating the rocks. There is a beautiful arch to the W.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishgalloon</strong> F623-035           Sheet 30 Impressive large island lying 500m S of Gubalennaun Beg quay (by Nimmo) (locally “Purteen”). The island is high and whale backed, grassy on top, and of sufficient steepness to make camping sites a premium. The island is grazed by sheep. Views in all quarters are spectacular. Landing and Water Landing onto sloping rock shelves at obvious cut in NE corner. Given any swell it could be tricky enough, onto rock shelves.  Swimming may be necessary if seas are lifting. No information re low water situation, which may allow more kelp and softer cuts to become available.  Scramble to top.  Water not found. The island has 3 sea caves on its E flank and a gem of a sea cave at its W end. This cave cuts right through the island N/S but also has a W exit. The N entrance is accessible at higher stages of the tide but is decidedly narrow at the lower end of the tidal cycle. All entrances are narrow and kayakers entering need to be wary of swell conditions. The run through is “interesting”. Tides run hard on the ebb off the S/SE corners of the island. Breeding Shags, Herring and Greater Black backed Gulls. <strong>Achill</strong> <strong>Island (Outer) – the Round of Achill Head</strong> The round of Achill Head may be done from either side, depending on conditions. The wind direction is everything, but beware of katabatics (downdraughts) on the lee side of the final ridge out to the head, a notorious local feature. The round trip from Doogort to Keem is about 26<em>km</em>. If going to Keel, it is even longer at over 33<em>km</em>. The round of Achill Island as a whole is about 80<em>km</em>, especially if the beautiful Achillbeg is taken in, and it is worth taking at least three days. This expedition round Achill Head will always be the crux of that trip, and has to be one of the foremost Irish sea paddling trips, to be grabbed when conditions allow, and with caution. Those on expedition along the coast will find it considerably easier to stick to the inner route through Achill Sound, but the round of Achill Head will be an integral part of the outer route. A trip around Achill and the Mullet Peninsula to the N is a week’s unrivalled expedition. This trip involves a challenging open crossing to Duvillaun Mór from Achill Head itself or Saddle Head to its NE. The Round of Achill Head is described here from the northern side, starting at Doogort. Doogort F672-089           Sheet 22/Sheet 30 This is an important launching or finishing point for the route outside the Mullet peninsula or Achill Head. There is a good beach – it is best to land on at the western end under the hotel. There are also a campsite with facilities and water. It is a bit of a carry from the campsite to the beach. The quay just NW has a landing and water, but no camping. Beware of overfalls to the E of the beach on the ebb. They are just W of Ridge Point at F704-109. Annagh Strand F602-077           Sheet 22/Sheet 30 The outer, western part of Achill is dominated by the two summits of Slievemore (671m) at F650-087 and Croaghaun (664m) at F554-058. Between these two, on the northern side, cut off from civilisation altogether, lies the utterly beautiful N-facing Annagh Strand. It is 9.5<em>km</em> or more into the anticlockwise round of Achill Head. The beach is backed by Lough na Keerogue (Lake of the Beatles). From Doogort, the coast follows the cliffs around, with at least one memorable arch, until a truly remarkable pap (teat) shaped hill (269m) at F607-076 lies just SE of the beach. This is a worthwhile trip in itself, either by hillwalk or paddle, and a must on the circumnavigation, as 16<em>km</em> lies ahead. The megalithic tomb at F602-076 is easily found as it has a ‘modern’ <em>bothán</em> (hut) built in its middle, anything but a normal sight, probably of Inishkea islander construction. The beach is backed by fairly steep boulders which are covered by the tide a couple of hours before and after HW.  Launching/landing is not recommended during this time, particularly in surf, which tends to dump.  Timing is critical.  Best to come and go between LW and mid tide on the sand. <strong>Achill</strong></p>\n",

A reef just offshore adds both technical interest and fear. Then it is SW to the head itself. A few storm beaches litter these impressive cliffs under Croaghaun. At least one is well enough sheltered, and in the right conditions, lunch has been enjoyed at Gubfoheratawy F567-077.  Conditions do need to be calm indeed to land. The head itself has broken islets off it and the innermost passage is passable under the right conditions. Moyteoge Head at F565-035 lies 5<em>km</em> ESE, behind which is Keem Strand. Keem Strand F562-043           Sheet 22/Sheet 30 A beautiful, horseshoe beach at the end of the road on the southern side of the island, Keem Strand is known to photographers the world over. Sheltered in most conditions, it surfs in southerlies. There are parking spots and viewpoints here, and many walks for Croaghaun and Achill Head. Extensive and excellent rock climbing has recently been developed on the E side of the valley.  This bay was the killing ground for the Achill Basking Shark fishery. Toilets (by day) are up from the beach a bit.  Camping is inhibited by this being a favourite courting spot, winter and summer, after dark. Gubalennaun Beg Quay F623-036           Sheet 30 Locally “Purteen”.  In trouble, this is the only dependable landing spot for dozens of kilometres in either direction. Keem Strand to the W may dump and Keel to the E is a famous surfing beach. This is a quay with no facilities except water and camping, and the certainty of a landing in any conditions. In nearby Keel can be had most anything – nice restaurants, pubs, provisions. The famous Achill Basking Shark fishery was based here until the mid-20<sup>th</sup> Century. Keel Strand F636-046           Sheet 22/Sheet 30 This is a famous surfing beach to be used by sea kayakers only in calm conditions. There is a camping and caravan site just in from the beach, with a convenient road and water near the village at the NW end of the beach. There is a golf links in the middle. The most remote part is in the SE where the Minnaun (or Menawn) Cliffs begin. Camping is excellent just behind the beach just about anywhere, though watch for golfers in the middle. <strong>Achill Island (Inner) – Achill Sound</strong> Sheet 30 The kayaker on passage can easily manage Achill’s inside route. The tide governs entirely only in its narrower places, and the wind mostly prevails. Achill Sound Bridge at F738-998 and Bull’s Mouth at F737-068 are major challenges to larger craft, but kayaks can always manage. Under most conditions, one may paddle under the bridge, even against the flow. This may involve a short sprint, or at worst, a portage. Avoid the very bottom of the tide because drying mudflats S of the bridge inhibit the process.  All facilities are available here, as Achill Sound is the main town of the island.   The spectacular new swing bridge at Achill Sound was opened in October 2008, replacing the 1947 structure whose pivotal mechanism had become stuck and corroded. From the kayakers’ perpective, the channel is clear and navigable, but do be aware that the direction of buoyage changes N of the bridge At Bull’s Mouth, at the northern entrance to the sound at F737-068, the eddies allow one to avoid problems. Wind against tide generates its fearsome reputation. Tides The tide flows simultaneously in from both ends to meet on the extensive mudflats just south of Achill Sound Bridge. Accordingly, the flood flows south under the bridge until local HW, which is 2:00 after Galway HW. The tide floods north through the southern entrance of the sound at Achillbeg</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Southern entrance to Achill Sound</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">4:50 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4-5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">1:35 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">4-5kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The fastest flow is at Darby’s Point, just inside the entrance.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishbiggle</strong> F746-067           Sheet 30 The population is 26, mainly adults. Inishbiggle is a large, attractive, low, hummocky island with a dozen or so inhabited houses, perfect for a half day expedition on foot or much longer.  Traffic is sparing, the local boat is the curragh, Irish is spoken and hay is saved by scythe. The post office is at F746-067. The abandoned school F753-067 (shown as a church on the OS sheet) thrived from 1948 to 1998.  Electricity arrived in 1978 and reliable water in 1990 (from Ballycroy side).  Previously water was local until piped in after 1981 from Achill side across the infamous Bulls Mouth, but the strength of the flow there defeated the engineers. The church at F758-066 is a “must see”, built in the 1870s with the best of quarried sandstone from Achill.  No nails were used in the timberwork, only dowels, all still deemed perfect in the 2000s when a local team of craftsmen set about to refurbish the lot.  The red pine timber was entirely free of worm.  Originally Protestant, the church was rededicated to interdenominational Christian use in 2003. Access was traditionally from Achill.  The islanders campaigned for generations for a cable car on the Achill side across Bulls Mouth and finally they lost that war in 2004.  The decision was instead to build waterborn ferry pier facilities, but on the mainland Ballycroy side, where the tidal flows are not quite as harsh.  Essentially Inishbiggle now looks E to the mainland instead of W to Achill.  The mainland road eastwards was much improved and is well signposted off the main road near Ballycroy. Embarkation and Landing The main access to Inishbiggle is nowadays from the mainland at Dorans Point F775-078 where there is a substantial pontoon and pier.  The ferry is run by Michael Leneghan 00 353 (87) 126 9618.  Landing is then at a similarly modern gabion reinforced pontoon and pier at Gobnadoogha F764-077 in the NE of the island.  It seems that Eamon O’Cuiv, the Minister for Arts, Heritage, the Gaeltacht, and the Islands, is serious about and has shown more genuine interest in the islands, even the English speaking ones, than any other minister, ever. Inishbiggle is at the northern end of the Achill Sound “inside route” and is separated from Achill Island by the Bull’s Mouth at F737-068. One may land on a beach of small stones, and at a modest slipway F739-069, just E of the Bull’s Mouth.  One may launch from the slipway opposite, on Achill, at F735-071, where there is some parking. Another handy embarkation point on the Achill side is at Bunacurry Harbour at F718-044 which is 2.5<em>km</em> SW of the Bulls Mouth. This is a stone and mud flat area, with a manageable carry even at LW, but plenty of parking. Vehicular Access All vehicles such as there are on Inishbiggle were driven there via Annagh Island that lies to the SE.  It is possible to drive from the mainland across the inner sound at a spot called locally Claggan F786–046 to F783-046 on Annagh, for a couple of hours when the sound dries at LW.  There is a fine boreen across Annagh S of centre to about F773-053, from where the strand to Inishbiggle can be driven for the bottom half of the tide.  6 hours dry and 6 wet is the rule, springs or neaps.  The inishbiggle drive-in point is just below the church. Anecdotally, this complex access becomes famous virtually every nationwide election or referendum held in Ireland.  Policy dictates that all the islands off the coast are balloted a few days before the actual polling day, for fear it might be necessary to try again and again.  Anytime there is a blow and the ferry can’t go to Inishbiggle, the local sergeant of the Gardai sets off from Claggan to Annagh and then to Inishbiggle.  Mostly he gets the business done quickly enough but not always.  All too often he has been caught unable to drive home that day, and in the line of duty, he has famously been photographed, up to his waist, carrying the ballots shoulder high, a beacon of civic duty.  Inishbiggle votes have therefore been dubbed “floating votes”. Ballycroy was the scene of the filming of the iconic “Ballroom of Romance” in 1981</p>\n",

They do this very well.  A good old race sets up between Inishaghoo and Inishbiggle, and a lesser one between Inishaghoo and the mainland, but neither race compares in the least to Bulls Mouth at the NW of Inishbiggle. It is feasible to walk to Illanamona for periods at either side of LW  and to wade across to Inisaghoo from the larger Illanamona at LWS.  The electricity powerlines run overhead the larger Illanamona island and Inishaghoo towards inishbiggle. Inishaghoo is surprisingly grassy given it isn’t grazed, or grazed enough nowadays, and could be attractive to the recreational user if it were.  Suspicion of foxes. The islands and particularly Inishaghoo are interesting for being a blanket peat bog resting on underlying sand/silt, which is quite the educational sight.  Bog oak protrudes aplenty from the very base of the peat and the peat itself runs under the tide in places.

        "description": "<p><strong>Illancroagh and Heath Island</strong> F786-030           Sheet 30 These two small islands jointly and effectively guard the entrance to the SE corner of Achill Sound North, a water system called Bellacragher Bay. The bay penetrates between the Corraun Peninsula and the mainland almost to Mallaranny, a narrow twisting inlet of great interest and a splendid option for a foul weather day. The embarkation point at F784-025 is just below the post office at Tonregee, halfway between Mallaranny and Achill Sound Bridge. Limited parking but with a handy stony landing. Illancroagh at F786-030 is the more interesting of the two islands. It can be landed on anywhere. There is splendid, huge, exposed bog oak on the western side, and a significant Common Gull colony in season. There are tide races all around. The tide runs E and W on either side. Wind over tide in these gaps normally happens on the ebb. These conditions provide a fun race just off the put-in point, and elsewhere at times. The tide also fills and empties round the duller Heath Island. The passage inwards from this point features strong tides at all the projecting points, and a varying landscape best savoured on the journey SE and inwards. Rhododendrons are followed by conifers, by grasslands suitable for remote yet convenient camping, then by ubiquitous peat-hags, sometimes close to the road and sometimes away from it. At the head of the bay are salmon farm tanks, always worth a visit to see these brutes leaping and displaying. The trick is to catch the tide inwards, lunch, and then catch it again outwards. Otherwise eddy-hop. Local HW is about Galway + 0230 in the furthest recesses of the bay, which is perhaps an hour later than local HW at the Bull’s Mouth. Tidal races are to be found at most of the twists and turns. The most playful ones are on either side of Illancroagh, and these are best enjoyed on the top half of the ebb. Being shallow, they do not particularly need a spring tide.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishkeas/Duvillauns Group</strong> F614-183           Sheet 22 This remarkable group of islands is well worth visiting. Embarkation Embarkation is from Portmore, a sheltered sandy S-facing beach about 3.5<em>km</em> W of Blacksod Point, and 1<em>km</em> S of a prominent tower on a low hill, known as Glash. The surf is much smaller at W end at a small slip called Port F614-183. Camping is best on machair at Fallmore F619-184, the E end of the beach. Surf can be an issue off the tip of the stormbeach off Portmore, and also 1.5km NNW at Surgeview Point.  To compound things, the tide runs hard in this area, especially on the ebb.  Alternatively, the most dependable launch of all is from Blacksod Pier itself, 4<em>km</em> E at F653-186, where the camping is less private but still wonderful.  This pier is by Nimmo, as is Saleen Pier 12<em>km</em> to the North at F670-290. The southern part of the Mullet peninsula is a stronghold for Corncrake. Tides The main west coast flood runs north from Achill Head, past Black Rock, then NNE past the outside of the group, from 3:20 before Galway HW until 3:05 after. The flood and ebb pour into and out of what is almost a sheltered ‘lake’ confined between the group of islands and the Mullet. The flows through the gaps seem to start a couple of hours earlier, at 5:15 before Galway HW until 1:00 after. They flood generally northeast/north through the channels between the Duvillauns, the Inishkeas and the Mullet. Certainly, in Blacksod Bay south of the Duvillauns, the ENE flood runs at about these times. The streams are weak inside the lake but achieve 2.5kn in springs off salient points and flow strongly through the gaps in the inner islands. From inside the islands, the ebb pours out of the ‘lake’ the same way and the timings are the reverse of the flood. The Spanish Armada Ships driven into the Blacksod area north of Achill could turn left or right. On 21<sup>st</sup> September 1588 two Armada ships sailed in. The <em>Duquesa Santa Ana</em> turned left into Elly Bay and safety, the <em>Rata Encoranada</em> turned right towards Achill. It put down its anchor off Doona point. It dragged and the ship went aground. All the crew got off safely. They then force marched around to Elly Bay and joined the <em>Duquesa Santa Ana</em> They all got going again but were shipwrecked in Loughros More Bay in Donegal. The survivors of all this walked overland to Killybegs where they were lucky to find the <em>Girona</em>, and joined it on its way to Scotland and safety, they hoped.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Black Rock</strong> F483-156           Sheet 22 The rock is known to locals as <em>Tór Mór</em>, and to Irish Lights as Black Rock. Like Eagle Island, Black Rock is a prominent lighthouse rock on which landing is impossible in most conditions. This, along with the fact that it is over 11<em>km</em> offshore and steep-sided, makes it essential that any visit is undertaken in (very) settled weather. Black Rock rates as one of the classic sea kayaking destinations in Ireland. It is a most dramatic and beautiful place to visit if kayakers get the right conditions in late April-May. Landing A landing is possible near the steep, carved steps on the SE side of the rock, with very low swell conditions and an unladen (or someone else’s, plastic) boat. There are 3/4 options from mid to high tide but only one at lower tides, about 20m from the sea-arch. There is a jetty at the E end, but there is often too much movement there. In the  right conditions (very settled!) the easiest landing is by the  jetty, where convenient rock platforms, especially at LW  allow “seal” type landings in addition to to the  jetty itself. The jetty is only place where kayaks can be easily managed. All other landings are very “physical” in terms of making boats secure and require a fit crew to lift and haul kayaks clear.  All steps and approaches from all 4 possible landing points are steep and in some cases in poor condition. All landings are very steep, in deep water, with any waves giving a lot of vertical movement. This gives a real risk of a bad bang if the boat hits any rocky outcrops while dropping with the waves. So, even in the calmest conditions, landing cannot be assumed and it is recommended to keep lunch handy to eat on the water before the long, open disappointed crossing home. After a successful landing, the boats must be hauled up the steep rock and tied to the iron stakes near the steps, which were probably chiselled into the rocks in the 19<sup>th</sup> Century. The walk to the top is steep. Launching is, as always, much easier. Always ask Irish Lights for permission for landing at a lighthouse. There is rough camping, but this is not advised, as lighthouse keepers have been known to wait months to be taken off after their stint of duty here. Bill Long states that it is reputed to be the ‘most difficult of the lighthouse rocks on which to land; totally inaccessible at times, either by boat or by helicopter’. No water. On a day trip, embark from Fallmore at F614-183 or Portglash beach at F612-202, for a 12<em>km</em> journey on a bearing of about 250<sup>o</sup>. If based on the Inishkeas, the distance is 8.5<em>km</em> at 235<sup>o</sup> from the western end of the sound between the N and S Islands at F556-218. Tides Departing from the Inishkeas, the only relevant tide is the main west coast tidal stream, which floods north from 3:20 before Galway HW until 3:05 after and the ebb in reverse. For a departure from the Inishkeas, a good strategy might be to leave at or after local LW, taking advantage of the last of the south-going stream, to arrive at slack and allowing a return after the start of the north-going stream. At least close in to the rock, tides run strongly, possibly 2kn. Paddlers report having to ferry glide to avoid being swept past. On Black Rock itself, the light character is FL WR 12s 86m 22/16M, i.e. flashing, white &amp; red sectors, every 12 seconds, height 86 metres, visibility 22 nautical miles in the white sector and 16 nautical miles in the red sector. It was, until recently, an acetylene gas light, one of the very few in Ireland or Britain. It was converted to acetylene from incandescent paraffin vapour in 1974 when it was automated. The acetylene system was decommissioned to a museum in Wexford in 1999 and replaced by solar power. In 1940, the S.S. Macville was attacked by a German bomber close to the Rock, shattering the lighthouse panes and damaging the roof. There are impressive, recently renovated dwellings of cut stone which was quarried from the rock. Amazingly, lighthouse keepers and their families lived here for 29 years until 1893. Then, dwellings for the families were built at Blacksod and the keepers would stay in shifts on the Rock in the years until the light was automated.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Duvillaun Mór</strong> F579-157           Sheet 22 Landing The current owner discourages landing.  There is an unreliable landing place on a somewhat sheltered sandy beach (bouldery at LW) on the southern shore at a point marked Gubnageeragh. The scramble up is awkward, but tired paddlers from Achill Head may take advantage. There is camping above the beach. Water is available in small lakes at the top of the island. Otherwise the much more reliable landing point in calm conditions is in a shallow bay on the NE side, almost facing Duvillaun Beg. Land onto flat rocks, in a sheltered cut, best just NW of a ruined dwelling. The island was abandoned in the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century. In the 1821 census, there were 19 people living on the island, and a community existed here up to at least 1917. The ecclesiastical remains on the brow of the hill at the western end are of a small Anchorite settlement being an eremitic establishment from the 6<sup>th</sup> to 10<sup>th</sup> Centuries. The square ruin is a killeen, a children’s’ graveyard. A carved flat stone on the summit depicts a Greek crucifixion on one side and a pre-Celtic cross (with a circle surrounding the cross) on the other. Well worth the visit. Unfortunately the most prominent feature of the top of the island these days, begun in 2007, is the “work in progress” of a modern house, unsightly in 2010, unless and until it is finshed. There is also a covered shed, and a forty-foot container. Overall, it is a mess. This epitomises the tragic mismanagment of our wild islands. The application for this development was granted planning permission to build on an SPA, so the Parks &amp; Wildlife service now have the massive headache of trying to limit the damage done. The N/W end is wild and dramatic, with small sea stacks and islets lying off the shore. The whole N and W sides are worthy of a slow passage.  Good cuts and stacks, and in particular two fine sea arches, merit exploration.  One horsehoe shaped sea arch near Drumacappul Island F570-160 has a very distinctive quartize keystone at its apex.  The other one cuts through Turduvillaun F566-160 and is a challenging passage. SPA Storm &amp; Leach’s Petrel, Barnacle Goose, Peregrine, Chough, Arctic &amp; Little Tern.

Greater Black-backed Gull breed. <strong>Inishkeas</strong> These islands are not named for Inis Gé (the ‘islands of geese’ in Gaelic), despite their ornithological significance. Instead, they are named for ‘Insulam Gedig’ in Latin, or Naomh Géidh or Saint Gé in Irish. The first written reference to the islands was in a letter from Pope Innocent III appointing a local Bishop in 1198. There was a thriving and stable Irish speaking population here from the late 18<sup>th</sup> to the early 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Nevertheless, no native writer ever emerged to record their lives from their own perspective, as happened elsewhere. Their story is pieced together from outside records. The population was stable at about 300 between the two islands for much of the time, though the South Island nearly always held more people than the North Island. They ran out of turf by the 1830s, importing it thereafter. They survived the 1840’s famine better than the nearby mainland, partly through fishing and piracy. Circumstances suited piracy because calm weather conditions in April and May becalmed many a sailing boat hereabouts. This all got out of hand so the coastguard placed a presence on the island to stop the practice. Ravaged always by storms, the islanders were almost beaten by a big one in 1857, and were finally defeated in 1927. As protection against the wind, they developed a special style of lazy bed for the potatoes, 2m across and 30cm higher on the windward side, to protect the fragile young plants. The climate being milder than the mainland, potatoes could be sown in February or even January, giving the islanders a huge competitive advantage at the market in Belmullet. They kept cows for milk, pigs for meat, and sheep for sale and for wool. They even kept horses to work the land, but more so on the N island where the widespread machair is more equine friendly. They also grew barley and their <em>poitín</em> was well known over a wide area, being favoured by the Boycotts, a well-known but not particularly popular local landed family. Their <em>poitín</em> was despised by the artist Paul Henry who visited in 1909. The boat crew got sozzled and gave him a trying journey back to Westport. A pier was built on the North Island in 1863 but it was blown away within the year. A sturdier model was built on the South Island beginning in 1888, which is there to this day and looking well, sheltering the strand in front of the village. Schools were established on both islands about 1899. Three policemen were stationed on the North Island about the same time to try to stop the worst of the illegal distillery industry. Relations between the islands were never good, except when absolutely necessary. Burials took place only on the North Island. The North Island also took in the Coastguard in 1849 and a police barracks fifty years later. Perhaps all this influenced things so that the North Island took the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War of 1922/23, and the South Island the Republican side. On one occasion, they all drew up on their own side of the narrow channel between the islands and pegged stones at each other. In 1927, the two islands were united in grief when, on the 26th October, their young men were cruelly taken, ten of them lost in one storm. A big low came in and they were fooled by the lull at its centre. The fishermen were yards off the North Island when the westerly winds struck suddenly and strongly. Many couldn’t retreat, and the last to drown were almost on the mainland well to the E. Each of the five currachs contained two brothers, mostly in their late teens. The community spirit was broken and another drowning a couple of years later emptied the islands by 1939. SPA Peregrine, Barnacle Goose, Golden Plover, Common, Arctic &amp; Little Tern.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishkea (Inis Gé) South</strong> F558-210           Sheet 22 The S island is perhaps the more attractive. The landing place is at the ruined village onto a sandy beach beside a stone pier. The beach is sheltered between the pier and Rusheen Island, which is accessible at LW. The pier has been extended and strengthened in recent years and many boats may be able to lay alongside for at least the top half of the tide. It is an outstandingly beautiful and pleasant island, not to be missed if in the area. Approached from the SE, the island is seen as low lying, with a white tower on the summit of a low hill, which, when aligned with another on the shoreline, gives a bearing of 120<sup>O</sup>. The two towers transit to the gap between Duvillaun Beg and Gaghta Island, useful to yachts. The ruined building on the skyline is the village school at the northern end of the village. As of 2007 there are up to six holiday homes finished or heading that way, up from one only for a generation. A lot of activity/people and boats tied up at pier over May Bank Holiday 2010. Minimum of 6 and possibly 8 houses now re-developed.  In October 2012 seven refurbished holiday houses were counted. Water Good reliable water can usually be had in a small well, 100m S of the pier, just above the first beach, Porteenbeg, where sand meets grass. Camping Good camping may be had at the village behind the houses. Beaches in rounded bays to the S of the village give good landings and camping, but not water. On circumnavigation, escape is possible on the Atlantic side at the head of at least three deep channels almost dissecting the island towards the southern end. Climbing There is what appears to be unlimited and excellent rock climbing on steep gneiss at the south-eastern end. Stan Pearson and Ian Stevens have been working here since 2002. There is a clean crag at the southern tip, and other crags on the outside as one moves N. Grades vary between severe and E1, 10m to 25m. Routes can look improbable, but the rock is fantastic with hidden finger jugs. On balance, the crags here are not as comprehensive as Gola, but it is quiet, for now anyway. Fauna It is renowned for its winter population of Barnacle Goose and Snipe. In 2009 5 geese wre electronically tagged by Doctor Cabot and friends, and tracked to NE Greenland, the first successful such scientific effort.  There is also a large population of seals.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Rusheen Island</strong> F561-212           Sheet 22 Rusheen is a small tidal islet off the strand in front of the South Island village. One may walk out at HW. It appears as an undistinguished islet, and one may land anywhere. Rusheen might not even have achieved individual mention here, save for its extraordinary history. It was a major centre of the whaling industry in Ireland in the first years of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century. Then as now, the Norwegian whaling industry wanted to do things its own way. Seasonally controlled at home, they established out-stations in other countries to bridge the gaps. They set up one such station in 1908 at Rusheen. They rented the island from the Congested Districts Board who had bought out the whole of Inishkea. It appears they also paid rent to the islanders, who liked to think they owned the place, and wouldn’t be persuaded otherwise. This may have been a Norwegian solution to a Norwegian problem, but was more likely an Inishkea solution to an Inishkea problem. Within months there was a thriving industry, with modern buildings, piers and slips, though made of wood, Norwegian style. Three whaling boats killed an average of 60 whales per annum, of all main types but mostly Fin. The Norwegians kept themselves to themselves, living on their boats, but some learnt Irish to deal with the workers. Steam power helped with the hauling and boiling of the whales to reduce them to oil and fertiliser, but water was in short supply. Hence the dam to be seen behind the houses on the South Island. The S islanders coveted all the employment for themselves, and wouldn’t let N islanders work for the Norwegians. This actually suited everyone in a roundabout way. The southerners could afford to employ mainlanders to till their fields and harvest their crops for them. North Island fishermen thrived because less fishermen meant better fishing. Also, lobsters seemed to thrive on the discarded whale offal. So did the pigs of the South Island which all went feral. Cray and lobster were plentiful and valuable, and were transported live. The cray went to Paris and the lobsters to faraway London. The whaling only lasted until 1911 when a combination of events ended it. There was a major strike. Further, the stench was unbearable. Even the mainlanders many kilometres away to the E complained. Finally, a fall off in demand for whale products ended the enterprise. The rusting and rotted remains of this endeavour are still to be seen as litter all over Rusheen. No drinking water was found.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishkea North</strong> F565-223           Sheet 22 The North Island is separated from the South Island by a narrow sound. The most visible feature is a huge prominent burial mound just E of the village at the SE tip, known as the Baily Mór. Its humpbacked shape is dominant from most angles, and it boasts carved stone slabs said to relate to St. Colmcille. Baily Beg is the smaller conical mound nearby. The dead of both islands were buried on the North Island. Landings Land at sheltered sandy beaches in the rounded bay in the SE, underneath the abandoned village. There are landing points also in many other spots. These include the N side of the SE tip, and a beach on the NE side, just short of the N tip. Escape is also possible on the Atlantic side, at the head of a deep cut behind the village, and probably other spots. Water Water has been found in a well that may need a little tidying, at the N end of the houses, in from the N end of the larger beach. Camping Camping in the bay in good weather is best at the Baily Mór mound, which is open but scenic, and otherwise attractive. In bad weather, some shelter may be had at the village. Birds One of the most important machair breeding sites for waders in Ireland. Lapwing, Dunlin, Redshank, Ringed Plover and Snipe. The breeding waders on the island’s main machair were splendid in May 2009. Redshank, Snipe, Dunlin, Lapwing, Ringed Plover, Oystercatcher, all present in good numbers. Also breeding Arctic Terns ( c.100 pairs) (at least 3 colonies) and Little Terns (c.20 pairs ) the latter also on the other machair NW west of  village.. The islands N of Inishkea have over recent years  a growing breeding  Greylag Goose population of a semi resident/feral nature. Little Tern were seen acting territorially in 2004 (fighting), which may indicate that they are starting to breed. Fauna There is a seal colony at the NE. David Cabot, noted naturalist, with an interest hereabouts, counted 1,000 grey seal here, the largest ever such count in Ireland. Seals do migrate and the local population was 693 in 1995 according to Oliver O’Cadhla. Tides A shallow spit Gubnacusha-Pluddany Rocks extends well E of the E point of the island.

The channel is shallow and various outlying reefs and islets cause much turbulence and clapotis even on relatively good days. The outside passage is also prone to swell and turbulence as it too has outlying islets and reefs on its northern and western side.  The inner passage undoubtedly closes with conditions, and certainly for larger boats, is safest at HW. Such boats may find the channel does not behave itself as it should. Yachtspersons feel there may have been a rockfall or boulders thrown into the gap by W gales, choking and changing things. Outside that keep to the centre, then the N side near the E end. On the Broad Haven side, about 2<em>km</em> to the SE, is a good little harbour called the Danish Cellar at F706-397, useful on passage, with water in the house and camping. Tides The main west coast stream touches land hereabouts, so the flood runs northeast/east from 3:20 before Galway HW until 3:05 after. Races occur on the Broad Haven side where returning eddies meet the mainstream. On the flood, a clockwise eddy comes back north along the Broad Haven coast from about 2.5km SSE of the head. On the ebb, anticlockwise eddies happen in two places. One eddy comes back north along the eastern side of Broad Haven bay and rejoins the mainstream west of Kid Island. The ebb also sets up anticlockwise eddies on the Atlantic side, southwest of the head. Local paddlers report that the tide always seems to be going north inside Eagle Island, on both flood and ebb. Embarkation Embark from either of three locations, the first for kayaks and the other two, safe anchorages both, are important to yachts on passage:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Best near HW, a sheltered S facing stony beach F628-345 on the S side of Annagh Head, well sheltered by offlying Annagh Island.It lies just below a new surfaced road and a new parking spot for Annagh Head, from which it is a convenent short carry to the shoreline, longer at LW. This launching spot is especially useful for a quick daytrip for smaller groups to Inishglora, Inishkeeragh, or Eagle.</li>\n<li>A working pier at F644-344 with good parking, on the northern side of Annagh Head, in a good big bay known as French Port, <em>Port na Francagh</em>.</li>\n<li>A wonderfully sheltered, isolated storm beach just further N, called Scotch Port at 647-361. The Commissioners of Irish Lights have a building at Scotch Port, for servicing the lighthouse on Eagle Rock and Black Rock. Here is a Corncrake reserve (one bird in 2003, 3 in 2010), and where Quail are not unknown. The last Corn Bunting in Ireland was in nearby Termoncarragh in 1992.12 – 15 pairs of Twite breed locally.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are also excellent embarkation places for a round of Erris Head, linking with Belmullet for a manageable walkback of about 8<em>km</em>. The paddle is about 32<em>km</em>. For a shorter trip, shuttle to the Danish Cellar at F706-397 for about 16<em>km</em> paddling. Either trip enjoys the Atlantic side of the Head, which is as scenic and committing as any.  The “Erris Head Walk” starts and finishes at Danish Cellar, as good as any of its kind. Passage On passage, there is camping manageable opposite the French Port pier, but no water. For water, ask in the house nearest the pier. This is the house once owned by Danny Gilboy, the late warden of the nearby Birdwatch Ireland reserve. Do not go onto the reserve without permission, or unless accompanied by a member of the Gilboy family. Do not camp at the head of the bay unless intending to depart near HW, because of the extensive flats which severely dry out. Camping at Scotch Port is convenient and uncomplicated. The islands off the NW of the Mullet peninsula share common access and tidal information. They vary from low and grassy to huge and rocky, with a significant lighthouse.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishglora</strong> F616-308           Sheet 22 Inishglora is a long and narrow low-lying island. It is interesting for its monastic ruins at the eastern end, and for its beehive stone formations. The church roof collapsed in 2003 after standing for centuries (millennia?). The Children of Lir The cairns on the island are said to be the resting places of the children of Lir. The children, Finola and her brothers Aedh, Conn and Fiachra were changed into swans by a jealous stepmother, Eva. She was jealous of the love of the children for their mother Eve, her eldest sister, who had died. The swans would keep the wit, the nature, and the speech of humans, as well as the power of music. This would continue until a prince from the N married a princess from the S, and they heard the voice of the Christian bell bringing the light of the new faith over the land. In all, they spent 300 happy years on Lough Derryvaragh in County Westmeath, 300 desperate and stormy years around Rathlin Island off the NE of Ireland (the “Sea of Moyle”), and finally 300 years at peace around Inishglora. Then, Saint Kemoc changed them back into humans. Alas, they were elderly crones. Here on Inishglora, as Christians, they ended their days at last. This is the saddest tale of ancient pre-Christian Ireland, well worth reading up on. Saint Brendan established the monastery here in the 6<sup>th</sup> century. He later became famous for being the first European to travel to America (Newfoundland), in a leather rowing boat, a large version of the <em>currach</em> still common today on the W coast of Ireland. Storm Petrel extensively colonise the E end of the island. Breeding waders Snipe, Dunlin, Oystercatcher, Ringed Plover. In the 1821 census, 7 people were living on the island. Landing and water There is a landing place opposite Inishkeeragh on a sandy beach on the southern side, just inside the eastern tip. Landing might also be possible on a storm beach in a shallow bay, midway along the northern side. There is a disused well at the eastern end, but the water is not good. Wells need use.</p>\n",

The sound immediately inside the island to its SE is always lumpy and best avoided in difficult conditions. Local paddlers report that the tide in the sound always runs NE, and that it is usually best to pass by further inside altogether, along the coast. As with all lighthouses, always ask Irish Lights for permission to land. There were two lighthouses, which form a transit, clearing obstacles nearby. The eastern light was discontinued in 1895, and the western light was automated in 1988. Its character is 3 white flashes every 10 seconds. The lights have a troublesome history. Storms wrecked the towers during construction and again afterwards. The keepers’ accommodation was washed away. A wave 68m high washed over the island in 1861. The tower filled with water and the keepers had to drill holes to open the door. The grassy top of the island feels sheltered, and appears to have once sustained the lighthouse personnel well enough. There is a substantial walled garden just above the northern landing steps. The lighthouse is powered by solar panels. Great Black-backed Gull abound in the long grass. Landing There are two landing spots. Each is at or alongside a small landing stage, each either side of the SE sound. Each is just outside the sound, one at the eastern tip, and the other at the southern tip, behind a stack. Steps are cut in the rock either side of these landing stages, where it is probably best to drag up heavy boats. Camping There is no water, but there is plenty of camping on the grassy plateau. However, an overnight stay runs a huge risk of stranding, should swell height increase, even a little. See Bill Long’s ‘Bright Light, White Water’ for descriptions of the huge seas which give this island it’s bad reputation. A short visit is recommended.</p>\n",

Belmullet is a most useful town on passage. A market town, all facilities are available. Tides The tide flows simultaneously into Blacksod Bay and Broad Haven, meeting on the drying mudflats on the Broad Haven (eastern) side of the town. The flow in the canal is usually from Blacksod towards Broad Haven, and reaches 4kn in springs. The mudflats on the Broad Haven side are severe, so don’t miss the tide. Approach and leave Belmullet near HW. Local HW is Galway HW +0040. An excellent evening meal is available in the hotel, and a handy B&amp;B is with Eileen Gaughan, Mill House, American Street, Belmullet, tel. 09781181. Her garden backs onto the canal just on the Broad Haven side. Kayaks can be left here conveniently and securely, which is otherwise a problem. Camping near the town is unattractive.

Kid Island guards the north-eastern approaches to Broad Haven – <em>Cuan an Inbhir Mhóir</em>. To pass NE inside the island is to be transported instantly into the surreal world of the N Mayo coastline. High and sheer cliffs dotted with huge caves vie with jagged stacks everywhere. Transcending everything are the Stags of Broad Haven. This is scenery worthy of any James Bond boat chase.

There is no water or camping on the island but there is excellent camping on machair at the launch point, on either side of the road approaching the pier. Excellent water is available from a pipe exiting the cliff at the northern end of the beach, N of the pier. This area is known locally as Carrowteigue – <em>Ceathrú Thaidhg</em>. Landings There are two. Land more easily in a dramatic cove in the NE, below some metal stanchions placed there long ago to aid getting sheep onto and off the island. However, the scramble from here is long and needs care, up rock slabs and then grass. Marvel at the thought of yapping dogs industriously herding sheep on such terrain. Many of both species must have had an unexpected swim or worse. The landing at the western tip is more exposed, but there is an easier scramble to the summit. The grass top is extensive and sheep-grazed. It was the sight of sheep in 2003 that tempted an ISKA party to try to find a landing. A long, interesting ridge runs out N, worth the scramble for the view. A cave appears to run right through this ridge, 20m above the water line. Light can be seen. Rumour has it that scuba divers climb up there and scramble all the way through. Breeding sheep, Puffin, Guillemot, and Great Black-backed Gull.

Only a few places truly merit this assertion. One thinks of Skellig, Moher, Aran, but these Stags are worthy of inclusion on any such list. Unlike the others, these Stags are little known, greatly enhancing their fame among the few fortunate enough to have visited. There are five stags in all – huge, dramatic, pointy topped rocks usually circled in foam. They lie 4<em>km</em> from the beach and 2.5<em>km</em> from nearest land. They are best seen from the SW. All but one have arches, and one is entirely bisected by a long narrow dramatic cave. The passage through and around the Stags is one of the significant Irish sea kayaking experiences. Embarkation The embarkation place is at Portacloy <em>– Port a’Chlóidh</em> at F840-440, a sheltered, sandy beach, attractive and N-facing. There is good camping just behind the beach on commonage, but ask for permission. Water is available in local houses. Launching and landing is easier at the pier NW of the beach under most conditions, but when there is any swell, this sweeps across the slip and can deposit small boats several feet lower down, which can be painful.  Also, the camping there is less satisfactory. There are no provisions available locally – this is a very remote spot. A watchtower on the headland marks the western side of the entrance to the bay. The whole coastline hereabouts, particularly from Portacloy W, has arches, caves, channels and passages second to none anywhere. These are easily enjoyed in plastic boats. Bring good head-torches for the caves, which are very deep. Local HW is Galway +0040. SPA Puffin, Storm &amp; Leach’s Petrel.  Storm Petrel also present. Huge Leatherback Turtle 2009. Landing Landing on any of the Stags without swimming is not normally possible. The central Stag (<em>Teach Dónal Ó’Cléirigh</em>) is highest at 97m. Land at the south-western tip at F840-478. To its S is <em>An Teach Mór</em>, second highest at 94m, on which the landing is easiest on the northern tip at F839-479, but the climb to the top is harder. Or, land at the more exposed southern tip at F839-476, which has the easier looking climb.

The landward side of the roof of the arch is the jowl of the pig. The view of the arch in itself warrants a visit. The island, when viewed from the sea, appears to be attached to the land behind. Embarkation and Landing The embarkation place is Porturlin – <em>Port Durlainne</em> at F885-425, which is a small fishing village. At the harbour in Porturlin, the camping is unattractive, but there is water out of a pipe on the roadside. Launching and landing is easy. No provisions. Beware that the lights on the quayside are not a transit for entry. The mouth of the harbour is narrow, and the ground outside is steep, blocking sight of most land features. If however, the features can be seen, entry is looking good. While there is obvious evidence of sheep grazing, no landing was found on the island. A deep-water landing can be made on the landward, southern side. Scramble up at the SW. Local HW is Galway +0040.</p>\n",

The channel is easily navigable by kayak and perhaps by other small, seaworthy boats, in good weather conditions. The passage is shallow and kayakers need to exercise good judgement in conditions when swell is running from in from W/NW direction.When entered from the W side, the passage through the high, steep, rock walls is impressive. The passage opens on the E side into an attractive bay, at the head of which (F936-426) lies a fine storm beach. The area provides an ideal lunch spot for kayakers en route from Portacloy to Belderg – <em>Béal Dearg</em>. Landing The island is steep and precipitous. Landing is difficult but possible on the sheltered ESE side onto shelving rock platforms. Easiest ascent is to traverse left to start and then to follow an obvious fault line that runs diagonally up to a grassy right hand slope. The ground is steep but the Puffin burrows give good holds on the grassy sward until one gains the ridge that sweeps in from island’s NE side. Follow this ridge line to the summit. Views are worthwhile on all sides. Camping is not a real option . Some seepage water found on rock slaps above the landing. Island is ungrazed and has a rich flora.   SPA Puffin and Storm Petrel.

The OS Discovery 1:50,000 sheet shows it as being attached to the mainland along its SSW flank, but in fact, the island is connected to the mainland only by a narrow steep sided storm beach. The impressive rock debris suggests that Atlantic storms surge occasionally through the gap. Landing is possible on either side but is most protected and practical on SE side. Here a narrow and attractive channel leads to the beach flanked on its N side by a narrow sea cave that is worth the look. The island yields easily to a short scramble from the storm beach It is flat and low lying and has the remains of a promontory fort. The island has several geological features of interest, from attractive outcrops, a dyke, and layered bedrock. The channel that separates the island from a sea stack on its W side is worth paddling through. Camping is good on closely grazed sea turf but requires a short steep carry above the landing. No water found. There is a ruin S of the landing on the mainland whose purpose was not identified.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Dún Briste</strong> G123-430          Sheet 23 Meaning “Broken Fort”, <em>Dún Briste</em> is well named. It consists of a sea stack broken away from the massive cliffs at Downpatrick Head. It is said there were people in residence when in 1393 it broke away. The rescue operation must have been something, though the gap will not have been as intimidating as now. The stack measures about 20m by 60m, and about 100m separates it from the mainland. Dún Briste rises absolutely vertically on all sides, and though it appears very sharp from the headland, it is more squat when seen from the side. The general area is well worth the visit. Parking may be had 1<em>km</em> from the headland. A pleasant walk leads up to the headland past the infamous <em>Poll na Seantoine</em>, a blow hole of huge proportions, dropping down into a cave system that opens up under the main cliff just inside <em>Dún Briste</em>. A plaque commemorates those locals who sided with the French when they landed nearby at Kilcummin just outside Killala in the invasion of 1798. The invasion force was at first successful, and took all before it, including Castlebar, capital of Mayo. Heading eastwards, it ran out of steam and was finally defeated in Roscommon a few weeks later. The French soldiers were treated as prisoners of war and sent home, but the local civilian insurgents were dealt with as unsuccessful civilian insurgents have typically been dealt with down the ages. Special enthusiasm was shown in dealing with the locals at the epicentre of the whole business who were thought to have sided with the enemy. Herded towards Downpatrick Head, they were forced over the edge into the blowhole and a gruesome death in the waves far below. A scientific party visited the summit by helicopter for a few short hours in 1980, the first human intrusion in almost 600 years.  At first they felt the buildings much older than 1393 and probably of mixed monastic / agricultural type.  After some study they thought they were in fact mediaeval, a longhouse of sorts, with some odd bolt-ons.  They would love to go back to make sure.  A quernstone was found on top of a perimeter wall.  Also of interest was a colony of wood lice which would have grown independently of the wood lice on the mainland for 600+ years. Fishing Locals fish from these cliffs in a special way, especially in the horseshoe bay just E of the headland. A long line is uncoiled and arranged to run free on the ground. A baited hook, a weight, and a big slab of timber several metres up the line is swung by hand in ever increasing arcs above the head. Finally the throw is made, and the business end finishes up floating way below. Huge Pollack are caught this way, and hauling them up is very hard work. Kayaking In calm conditions a launch may be had on rock shelves below the parking space at G125-424. Otherwise, the beach below (just N of) Ballycastle is fairly dependable G104-394. Dooclogh Pier G096-401 is the most dependable.  The paddling is thruly fantastic. A cave system links the W facing shore of Downpatrick Head, entering near the parking area, through the blowhole <em>Poll na Seantoin,e</em> and onwards to exit hard by <em>Dún Briste</em>. Narrow in places and shelved in others, the trip is a must, but timing is the key to the trickier passages.</p>\n",

The system stretches across the bay, is broken in the middle (through which the River Moy drains), shows standard surfing beaches to seaward, dunes all the way, and more sheltered backwaters to landward. On the E lies the town of Enniscrone, and on the W lies Killala.  In between is Bartragh Island. The one non-standard item is that the sea has broken through at Killala as well as at Enniscrone. Both piers, at Killala and at Enniscrone, are by Nimmo. The island itself is unremarkable. It runs 4<em>km</em> ESE/WNW. The backwaters are clean and pleasant because unusually they wash through, and sea-trout are apparent. There is always a channel between the island and the mainland. Stands of Sycamore try to survive in the dunes. Sheep abound. The highest area is at the W end. Two wrecks punctuate the view of unbroken sand and surf to seaward. Greenshank. Embarkation The easiest approach may be from Killala itself, at the pier down by the Coastguard Station. From here has been dredged a permanent channel, quite shallow at LWS but always navigable. It is muddy and unpleasant, a reminder of what the whole backwater would be like were the island not washed through twice a day. The widest part of the backwaters of the island, just outside the Killala channel, is called Killala Pool. The slip at Killala does not reach all the way down to the lowest LWs, and a carry over gooey mud to one side is sometimes called for. Hard by the launching spot is the local fishing co-operative fish shop, very good value and quality fresh and frozen seafood.

The islands next described lie in the general area of this narrow entrance separating Sligo Bay from Sligo Harbour. SPA SPA designation attaches to nearby Ballysadare Bay to the S, (Whooper Swan, Golden Plover, and Bar-tailed Godwit), Sligo Harbour (Great Northern Diver, Whooper Swan, Golden Plover, and Bar-tailed Godwit), and Lissadell Strand in Drumcliff Bay to the N (Barnacle Goose, Whooper Swan, Golden Plover, and Bar-tailed Godwit).

Closer to Sligo Harbour the flow rate increases, peaking about 1km inside Sligo Harbour, north of Oyster Island, at up to 6kn in springs. The flood divides at the Metal Man, mid-harbour entrance. The main flood flows east through the shipping channel north of Oyster Island and on towards Sligo. A strong secondary flow passes between Oyster and Coney and circulates anti-clockwise around the deep pit just south of the western point of Oyster. The ebb reverses all this. There are significant danger areas hereabouts. With wind over tide, which usually means the ebb, quite a sea state is generated in the main channel north of Oyster Island and also between Oyster and Coney Islands, in the region of the Metal Man. There is a submerged spit curving out from the northern end of Coney Island at about G615-399 to Black Rock at G598-401. This is partially exposed at LW. In any sort of sea, there are big breaks here and on the sandbanks on its northern side. Embarkation For all the islands, launch from the slipway just W of the RNLI station at G631-397. There is good parking above the RNLI Station. The pier and slipway are used by local fishermen and for boats accessing the cruiser yachts moored in the bay in summer.</p>\n",

Its monastic ruins are excellent and worth the visit in themselves. A row of fairly recently abandoned houses lines the SE side above the unsatisfactory pier/slip. Fields, bog, lake and scrub comprise the rest. The NW point has interesting small cliffs and passages. Tides Local HW Galway +0040. Tidal movements are not strong. Embarkation Inishmurray lies about 6<em>km</em> WNW out from the nearest and most common embarkation points, either side of Streedagh Point G632-514. Choose depending on conditions between the NNW-facing beach at G637-510, and a smaller SW-facing beach at G631-502. Otherwise the position is a bit more complex. By far the most convenient embarkation place for bigger boats or larger groups of kayakers is the harbour at the village of Mullaghmore at G709-576, about 15<em>km</em> ENE from the island. Here there is parking and dependable shelter. There are several other possibilities, first amongst which is 7<em>km</em> S of the island, at Ballyconnell North, a N-facing beach at G566-462, where reasonable parking for a handful of cars. Landing From the S/SE direction, there is a roofed building prominently visible at the E end of the island. This is the schoolhouse, which lies just above the pier wall. The shoreline generally is slippery boulders and slab. Landing with kayaks can be difficult, even at the pier wall, which is not very sheltered and distinctly open to the SE. The village is a single line of houses just above the shore just W of the schoolhouse. Landing can also be had further W on the S side in the often more sheltered deeply indented coves at G571-537, W of the village, onto rocks. This spot, though sheltered, is more suited to boats that can be tied or anchored, such as dinghies or ribs where one can hop or step onto rock. For those overnighting, a landing here leaves a good distance to carry gear to the better campsites near the schoolhouse. Camping and Water No drinking water was found though there is a lake in the centre. Camping is perhaps best at the schoolhouse. Wildlife The Eider and Common Scoter ducks are sometimes found here in summer. This was until recently considered almost the most southerly breeding area of the Eider. Local History Of special interest on the island is the monastic ruined settlement, founded by Columba in 550 AD. It is inside a Bronze Age fortification, the walls of which were once about 4.5m high. They are now half that, having been restored in 1880. The enclosure of cells, beehives, churches, altars, and carved stones, which in themselves make the island a must for a visit, are in better condition after 1400 years than the village houses after 100. The men-folk of the island were buried inside the enclosure and the women outside, at Teampalnamban about 150m distant.There are cursing stones here, five <em>Clocha Breacha</em>, capable of cursing ones enemies. The cursing stones have recently been removed by the OPW and are kept in the old school house. You may be lucky and be on the island when the OPW are working there and get to see the stones. The island was pagan until Columba built a new monastery inside the fort and installed St. Molaise as Abbot. The monastery obtained fame almost immediately. Columba, back on a visit, borrowed a book from the library. Without telling Molaise, he copied it. A furious Molaise demanded the return of the copy. Denied, he appealed all the way to the High King, Diarmuid, who was then like the Supreme Court is today. His judgement was ‘to every cow its calf, to every book its copy’, probably the first ever recorded copyright decision in Western Europe. Worse was to come. Columba still wouldn’t return the copy. Diarmuid, feeling he was being challenged, set out westwards with an army of 3,000 to punish Columba and his followers. Columba resoundingly beat the army of the high king near Culdrennan outside Sligo, with the loss of all his men. Columba was upset by all these unanticipated downstream consequences of his thievery. He relented, and presented himself on Inishmurray to Molaise in confession. As penance, Molaise banished Columba to Scotland, never to return until he had converted to Christianity as many pagans as the 3,000 killed in the battle. Columba sailed, and didn’t settle until he could no longer see Ireland. He landed at Iona, and there founded his greatest ever monastery. He never returned to Ireland. The Vikings raided Inishmurray in 795 and 802, and the Black and Tans in 1921. In 1915, a British warship, mistaking the island for a submarine, torpedoed it. It is thought the fort was mistaken for a conning tower. The islanders were shaken but not stirred. The island was infamous for <em>poitín</em> making. There being no natural embarkation point for access to the island, and no easy landing, visits by the authorities were few. This enabled the undisturbed islanders to distil the best illicit whiskey in the country, marketed as ‘Old Inishmurray’. When the Revenue officials did come, they had to hire boats locally and word would escape. Then, in the absence of any one truly sheltered landing spot, it seems it was always necessary for the local boatmen to circle the island looking for the easiest landing place. The illicit brew was normally well hidden by the time anyone got ashore. The school was built in 1889 when there were 102 people living here in 15 houses. There were only 46 in 1948 when the last people left. The islanders were renowned for a combined rowing/sailing technique unique in Ireland which made them the safest, fastest and bravest sailors around.</p>\n",

It consists of 13<em>km</em> of majestic cliff scenery from Malinbeg at G494-799 to Teelin at G593-753. There are numerous waterfalls coming off the cliffs to shower under, some up to 100m high. The shuttle is tedious so consider doing the expedition there and back. There are several beaches well spread out along the base, for breaking the journey should conditions allow, none of which is attainable from the land. One stony beach is reasonably sheltered at G523-785 and is important, being one third of the way from Malinbeg. It is just E and somewhat in the lee of a vaguely prominent headland, the other beaches being nearer Teelin, at Bunglass and just W of it. Sail Rock, for hard climbers only, is just E of Carrigan Head. Deep caves along the way add excitement for those who like their adrenaline pumped. Tides Local HW is Galway +0040. Nothing is reliably known about tidal movements along the north coast of Donegal Bay, or when they start, but they are considered to be weak, except off salient points.</p>\n",

Landing, while safe at the sheltered pier and steep slipway, is a little awkward and involves a steep carry. There is excellent camping on commonage immediately above the pier, by a white house with three chimneys and a garage. The nearby beach is splendid. Drinking water is available at a tap external to an outhouse beside a dwelling, near the crossroads in the village on the road to the beach. The beach is a huge carry. The rock climbing hereabouts, mostly under the prominent signal tower, is nationally important. Malinbeg’s situation makes it a most attractive venue for paddling to Rathlin O’Birne Island, E along the Slieve League cliffs, or N to Glen Head. Basic provisions may be had in the village, as may B+B, and the hotel at Malinmore (3<em>km</em>) is excellent for eating and drinking. Local HW Galway +0040. Finding the harbour from the sea needs care. Once close, the white house with three chimneys in a line is prominent atop a low cliff and is just above the pier, which can then be made out. At night, the pier is lit. From out to sea to the SE, aim between the beach and the prominent square signal tower. Coming from the E, pass the prominent white strand, well to the E of the tower until the white house appears. Coming from the N, the spread out village disappears as one paddles past the promontory with the obvious signal tower, off which are two prominently visible (actually there are more) rocks. Turn in left (E) after the rocks. Follow around until the white house appears.</p>\n",

It has a major lighthouse, now automated. While the building was completed in 1846, the light was not fitted for another 10 years. The light is 35m above sea level on an all white tower. It flashes white and red every 15 seconds. Lighthouse keepers and their families lived here from 1856 to 1912, when the families moved to shore dwellings in Glencolumbkille. Ireland’s first nuclear powered light (and thought to have been the world’s most powerful) was switched on here on 15<sup>th</sup> August 1974. This was replaced with wind power in 1987 when the nuclear battery became worn down. Wind power was replaced with solar energy in 1993, and that is the position to this day. Two parallel cut stone walls, 2m high and 4m apart, enclose a roadway, once used by the lighthouse keepers as protection against the Atlantic winds on their journey from the beach to the lighthouse. N of the walls lies the kayak landing, and beyond it across the ‘moraine’, lies the remains of lazybeds, a house, and what looks like the evidence of monks’ dwellings. South of the landing there is a monastic settlement that has some cross inscribed crosses, altar stones, and offering bowls.  The site is now very ruined but still interesting. There is a covered well built stone well located northwest down the slope from the monastic complex. The water in July 2013 needed to be cleaned out but should provide good water after a few days. Several other small seepage streams are to be found around the main landing beach and at the old Lighthouse landing steps on the north side. The island has good camping on the ledges just west of the main boulder beach landing on the north side. There were large numbers of breeding Herring and Greater Black-backed Gulls, a flock of Greylag Geese,  1 Corncrake calling and 1-2 pairs of Great Skua in July 2013. SPA Storm Petrel, Leach’s Petrel, Barnacle Goose, Terns. Landing and Embarkation Best landing is at a stony beach visible from the mainland in the NE in a somewhat sheltered bay, where the island appears to be almost dissected.

The Evelyn Marie fishing boat went down here in 1975 and then the Carrig Una in 1976, tragedies that rocked west Donegal. <strong>South West Donegal</strong> The stretch of coastline from Rathlin O’Birne G467-801 to Loughros Point G645-934 is dominated by huge stretches of awesome cliffs, hundreds of metres high, accessible from land only in Malinmore, Glencolumbkille and Port.  Along the entire length lie mighty sea stacks, all close in to the shore.  These are almost unknown to the general body of sea going folk, certainly outside the ranks of a new breed of adventurers that specialise in the challenge of climbing them. Climbing sea stacks is not entirely new.  The televised ascent by legendary Joe Brown and Chris Bonnington of the Old Man of Hoy in the Scottish Orkneys many years ago is well renowned.  It is thought that the first ever organised and recorded rock climbing in Ireland was in the NE corner of Ireland’s Eye in County Dublin.  Anyone who visits Loop Head will look with awe across the 100m high gap to the prominent cairn atop its huge sea stack, Diarmuid and Gráinne’s Rock. British climbers Mick Fowler and Steve Sustad placed it there in 1990.  But there has been an explosion of this kind of activity this century, mostly by Donegal based climbers, led by Iain Miller. Their passionate pursuit of this new adventure model is much to be admired. One may only marvel at the level of commitment necessary to flourish at this new sport, access often requiring difficult and obscure manoeuvres.  Typically the approach requires the climber to descend a frightening grass or scree cliff, often probably never previously descended, maybe needing an abseil and a fixed rope for the retreat.  The right place is then achieved horizontally, either by “coastaleering” or by floating, necessarily in the flimsiest of inflated “boat”, it not being practical to carry anything remotely seaworthy on such an approach.  Incredibly, even the outside face of Sturrall headland has been climbed, accessed by scrambling down the N face to a sea level slab, facing the collection of off-lying stacks. Scramble around the corner S to the foot,</p>\n",

High cliffs all round make it a dramatic place, as all entrances are narrow and a tricky place to be in heavy swell. The N-facing breach is too narrow and dangerous for kayaks at LW. Breeding colonies of Kittiwake, Guillemot, Razorbill and Fulmar. For land access to the lovely shark’s fin stack to the S, descend the 200m grass slope on the headland to the lonely pebble beach facing the stacks. Keep to the grassy slopes, directly above the beach and avoid the scree to your right.  The landward arête of this southernmost stack yields a magnificent middle grade climbing route.  Its smaller neighbour is also climbed. Land access to Tormore itself is much more complex, by coastaleering from the beach well to the E (its own access an enormous challenge), but finally by water surface, a full 3.5 hours for the 2<em>km</em> from a car at Port.  Climbers term the stack inside Tormore as The Hidden Stack.  At 150m high Tormore is considered the Daddy of Donegal’s Sea stacks.  It can be seen from Dungloe, approximately 40<em>km</em> to the NE! The climbing route on Tormore is by its landward arête, which as a feature can clearly be seen from any position along this coast. SPA Peregrine, Chough, Grey Seal.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Glenlough Bay Group</strong> G568-908          Sheet 10 Firstly, there is a group of three stacks in the E part of the 1<em>km</em> wide bay.  Access by land to the beach is not easy.  From Port follow the cliff top path N for approx 3<em>km</em>. Once you pass the Tormore viewpoint G557-906, continue to follow the cliff tops as they descend along Glenlough Bay. At G567-904, descend to the wide gully immediately to the SW of the large ominous looking buttress. Follow the stream down this gully until approx 70m above the sea, traverse NE for 50m and descend the scree slope to the beach, directly below the ominous buttress. The largest middle stack is the easiest to climb in the technical sense.  The WSW stack is technically difficult, but the small 30m ENE quartz tower is magnificent, extremely serious, technically hard, and it is reported that a fall from the last 12 metres, consisting of the summit ridge, would be fatal. Secondly, at G573-916 about 1<em>km</em> NE, just 250m past the headland 500m N of the Glenlough River, lying one third of the way from Tormore to Gull, there is a fine 60m twin headed stack.  A very atmospheric gothic sea channel separates the stack to landward. Land on its SW side and climb easily to the W summit.  The E summit is much more difficult of access.  Much loose rock and certain death await those who fall from here. In between, there is also a land seacliff crag at G569-911, a hanging slab of immaculate quartz, that sits at the tip of the headland at the ENE end of Glenlough Bay, about 300m W of the Glenlough River. Access is a short exposed scramble down to the top of the crag.</p>\n",

Land and camp at a sheltered sandy beach in an E-facing little bay called Portnatra on the E side. There is also an attractive landing at the W end of Roaninish in an embayment called Portnagall formed by its satellite islands. At times of HW this area is an attractive bay full of channels that allow passage by kayak and small craft between Nee Beg, Nee More, and Roaninish itself. There is evidence of some settlement at Tonavally just above the W landing where there are the remains of four small buildings. Interestingly, there is a named entrance to access Tonavally from the S called Portnageeragh, which suggests that this channel was used in former times. The main island has at least three satellite islands Nee Mór, Nee Beg and one unnamed on its W/ NW sides and one on its E flank also unnamed. All are similar in topography to the main island, low lying and grassy with many humps and hollows,  except the unnamed Emost island which has predominantly large areas of storm beach. All entrances to the various channels, including Portnatra, are subject to swells and boomers can catch the unwary. A small lake by the campsite should be treated with caution as sheep graze the island. No other water spotted. The Greenhaven was wrecked on the W side in 1956. She sat on the island until a storm in the late eighties, and since then is submerged just off the shore.  The wreck and the island featured in a BBC feature film in the 90s entitled “The Secret of Roaninish”.  In 2001 kayakers found no sign of the remains of the wreck even at LW.

Breeding species include Gulls, Eider, and Storm Petrel. SPA Storm Petrel, Tern. <strong>Aranmore Group</strong> This group extends from Illancrone in the south to Aranmore itself in the north. Embarkation The normal embarkation place for the Aranmore group is from Burtonport at B717-152 which has good facilities in terms of pubs, restaurants and shops. Launch from the main wide slipway, but it can be busy. Be sure though to park 150m away in front of the pub. This will keep the slipway and pier free. Otherwise there is a smaller slipway 200m to the S of the main slip, where also good parking and even toilets.  Also, be aware that the sea in the immediate vicinity of Burtonport is very protected and is no indication of what may be happening outside. The North Rutland Channel runs SE to NW and is the narrow sound between Eighter and Rutland which gives access from Burtonport out to Aran. The SE entrance to the Channel is difficult to identify from Burtonport. Aim for the two-story house on the Rutland skyline WSW of Burtonport pier. Navigation locally is far more challenging in windy conditions than any casual glance at the OS 1:50,000 map might suggest. Accordingly, some considerable nautical detail is given for this area, and a proper nautical chart is recommended to any visiting group. Maps and Charts Chart 1883, Crohy Head to Bloody Foreland (1:30,000) covers the area. The details of the seabed give a good indication of what to expect on the surface in bad weather and in this respect it is much better than the OS 1:50,000, sheet 1. However, many of the beacons on the approaches to Burtonport are not marked on the chart but can be worked out from the Pilot or Sailing Directions. This is a complicated area. The Sailing Directions (South and West Coasts of Ireland) give a good sketch map of Aran Sound, shows most of the beacons and all of the shoals. The Pilot gives detailed information but needs to be used with a map or chart. The older half-inch, (1:126,720) sheet 1 OS map is virtually useless (unusually perhaps) for bad weather navigation in this area. Tides Tidal streams in the locality flow strongly and can cut up rough in contrary winds. Local HW and LW are an hour after Galway HW. The tide floods from both ends of Aran Sound simultaneously, meeting near the Carrickbealatroha Upper beacon at B695-147, midway between Rutland and southeast Aran. This is also sometimes known as Stream Rock and the beacon is a wide square tower, 5m high. On the eastern side of Rutland, the tides meet halfway up, at Teige Rock, a large white beacon, at B713-145.</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"2\" width=\"260\"><strong>Aran Sound</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">In</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">5:20 before Galway HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">Out</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">0:50 after Galway HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>The tide floods southeast through the North Rutland Channel, strongly, up to 2-3kn in springs, but one may eddie-hop going against.

The main street is immediately along the beach on the N side.  There is now a substantial pier.  Several house are being rebuilt, some already have and there are even some brand new log houses. View the remarkably located schoolhouse to W.  Apparently none of the islanders wanted it closer to the village as the land was too valuable to them. Winter storm waves rolled across much of the W side.  Thus the better land in the middle and E was too valuable to sell for a school.  That was a standard way of looking at things since Adam and Eve were children.  One wonders what they would make of EU “set aside”?  Peadar O’Donnell taught here. The island was abandoned by its 10 families in March 1955, when their numbers suddenly dipped below a tipping point and there weren’t enough hands to share the harder work of hauling boats to safety, cutting turf etc.  “<em>Inniscaorac – My Account</em>” privately published 2008 by former resident Susan O’Donnell tells the story in detail. Landing and Camping Land easily at E end of the N side onto a gravel beach, or on the ESE side of the island, on N side of the projecting Portnamweela, where there is a sandy beach, and once the island well. There is good camping by the ruined houses on short sheep-grazed grass. Good water is to be had in a well, found behind ‘main street’ along the north side. N.B. Wells need use, so you may need to clean it out and let the sediment settle before you take water from it.  The islands used this well for all purposes other than drinking as the water contained too much iron, and they preferred a number of wells on the E side, or even trapped rainwater.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishfree Upper</strong> B715-126          Sheet 1 2<em>km</em> SE of Aranmore, at the mouth of Dungloe Bay. Large interesting island worth exploring. Homes on the NW apparently result from recent settlement by English and Welsh families, one permanently occupied by a saxophonist from 1991 to 2013. The island was electrified August 2000. The island is developing a tradition in art that yet may rival Tory. The shipwreck of the ‘Mallrin’ is to the W. There is tidal peat with bog oak (some say giant cedar?) in the baylet W of the S point at B714-114. The old schoolhouse is at the E end of the island. Landing and Camping Land easily on sheltered sandy beach just SW of N point of island, where there is a slipway, if preferred. The landing point is backed by machair that is friendly to camping. Cows grazing. No water found. You may land and camp also at a beach to the SW at B711-114.  2 Corncrake were heard in 2010. Tides Tides flood strongly E past the N point. Peadar O’Donnell Peadar O’Donnell (1893 – 1986) taught for many years. Born and bred in nearby Dungloe, he wrote of island life – ‘Islanders’ 1927 and ‘Proud Island’ 1975. He also dealt with his political phase in ‘The Gates Flew Open’, a reference to his escape from internment as a Republican during the Irish Civil War in 1923. He was the leader of IRA militant agitation for land reform in the 1930s. This led to the withholding from Britain of land annuities by the fledgling Irish government of the new state. These annuities were due as the repayment (mortgage fashion) of the capital investment in agricultural land made by the Congested Districts Board pre-independence in 1921. The economic war with the UK that followed brought Ireland to its knees. Strangely, when the dispute was settled in 1938, as part of the deal, the UK handed back to Ireland its maritime ports. After independence, Britain had continued to occupy and utilise deep harbour naval facilities at Cobh, Bearhaven and Lough Swilly (Rathmullen). The UK would regret its folly almost immediately, as they could have well done with these ports during the Battle of the Atlantic that followed during World War 2. Ireland could hardly have remained neutral in such a conflict were these ports in British use. One side or the other would surely have invaded. The association of such a remote place with such momentous events is amazing! Notwithstanding his nationalistic background, he was essentially a man of the people. “Adrigoole” in the late 1920s was about a remote crofting family starving to death, that he felt especially appalling in the context of the new Irish state.  He felt it would never have happened under foreign / British rule. He spoke of what he called “human rights” in1932, fully 16 years (and a World War) before Eleanor Roosevelt addressed the United Nations in that regard in 1948. He started the idea that became “The Bell”, an independent and truly important outlet for Irish writers in a time of strict censorship.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Rutland Island</strong> B704-151          Sheet 1 Very much the largest of the outer islands immediately inside Aran, SW of the North Rutland Channel. There are a fast-growing number of newly built holiday homes on the NE quadrant of the island facing Burtonport. In late 2009 the pace seemed if anything to be accelerating, bucking the national trend.  There is even a RoRo slipway, which is only one step short of a crane. West of a line from the NW tip to the SE tip, the entire island is a desert of prickly sand dunes. This is a most attractive island, accessible yet quiet, whose main tourist feature must be its magnificent beach running the length of its W side and where few others would ever be met. Absolutely worth a visit. Landing and Camping Landing on the main beach would involve a lengthy and difficult carry, easily avoided by accessing a small, hidden, sandy cove through a short, narrow channel just inside the mouth of the North Rutland Channel (beside a sign warning of a Power Cable). A 100m carry then accesses splendid machair short-grass camping in the shelter of the dunes and near the north end of the beach. Alternatively, land 150m further SE into the North Rutland Channel, onto a steep, sandy beachlet at B705-150, just seaward of a new house with new steps to the sea and just inside a green navigation marker. This gives a shorter carry to the same camping, but the beach, although sheltered, is steep at most points of the tide. The island has long been electrified, but there is no mains water. Tides Beware strong tides all around, and foul ground off the SW tip. There are many landings possible all around the island. History Rutland Island has a remarkable history, having been the commercial capital of NW Ireland 200+ years ago. The herring industry thrived so strongly in the 18th Century that the local landlord Lord Burton Conyngham invested heavily in providing access via Burtonport to a major new town on Rutland Island. By about 1785, the island had a Post Office, hotel, harbours, fish handling facilities and a population of hundreds. Then the herring shoals declined and disappeared altogether in 1793. The town degraded somewhat but was still occupied in September 1798 when the second wave of French invaders to Ireland that year landed on Rutland. Napper Tandy, commander of the United Irishmen on board, raided the post office. He found out that the first wave of the invasion of the previous month under General Humbert, which had landed at Killala and had some early successes, had been beaten. The 1798 Revolution was as good as over. Tandy retreated towards France, was caught, but not executed. Wolfe Tone would accompany a third wave of invaders a couple of months later but they were beaten by the Royal Navy in a battle just off the back of Aranmore. When Ireland became independent in 1921, the country was awash with licenced public houses.  “Pub” numbers were growing and out of control.  To slow things down, a law was passed that to be allowed to open a new pub anywhere, even in an area of huge population growth which therefore might need the like, it was necessary to close down two other pubs.  The two other pubs closed didn’t have to be nearby pubs, they could be anywhere.  A market in pub licences flourished for a time.  The absurdity of the rule was forced home whan a Dublin pub was opened, one of the two pubs it had closed elsewhere being that of the Rutland Island pub, hundreds of miles away, and which anyway hadn’t served drink for eighty years.  The law has since been changed. The island remained the administrative capital of the region for a century. A channel to the nearby mainland was dredged out, so that Burtonport became eventually more important and took over the marine industry hereabouts. The island was inhabited until the 1960s. Nowadays there are holiday homes on all these inner islands. In 2003 a marina for pleasure yachts has been planned, but lack of funds has frustrated progress. The main fishing hereabouts is now out of half-deckers, for crabs and lobsters. Trawling is very much in decline. This area may thus become principally a tourist destination, but that is the way of things. Rutland badger are much smaller than normal, so that they were once commonly mistaken for Mink.  They also have distinctive white noses.</p>\n",

The North Rutland Channel runs SE to NW and is the narrow sound between Eighter and Rutland which gives access from Burtonport out to Aran. There are a number of holiday homes clustered in the SE quadrant. These have the distinction of appearing very unchanged from the original construction. Landing is most convenient at the southern tip of the island onto a sheltered SE-facing beach in the North Rutland Channel. Camping is all around. The houses collect water, not all of them in sealed tanks. There is a rumour of a pitch and putt course on the island, unauthenticated.

Ruin in mid-island. <strong>Aran Sound South</strong> The South Sound of Aran on the E side of Aran is a fearsome place with a high swell, particularly if the swell is from the N. The safest N/S passage goes approximately 200m east of Aileen Reef. Aileen Reef extends SE for 1<em>km</em> from Cloghcor Point at the SE corner of Aran. Boomers may be experienced over the shallows on the E side of the sound at a point E of Cloghcor Pt., off the beach on Rutland. You may also encounter boomers immediately west of the Carrickbealatroha Upper rocks beacon B695-147, which is shown but not named on the 1:50,000 OS map. If you plan to paddle from the village (Leabgarrow) on Aranmore to Burtonport via the S end of Rutland, with swell about, it is best to follow the channel S to Clutch beacon, marking the S end of Aileen Reef and then turn E, aiming for the beacon on the S end of Rutland. This should avoid any of the breaks on the E side of the Sound. <strong>Aran Sound North</strong> A large swell runs through the Sound of Aran in strong north-westerlies. At the N end, Blind Rocks at B686-166 and Ballagh Rocks at B693-170 are places to be avoided. Blind Rocks are just E of Calf Island and Ballagh Rocks (marked on the 1:50,000 OS map) are 0.6<em>km</em> NW of Eighter Island. In these conditions, the North Sound is virtually closed. Waves frequently break <em>over</em> the Ballagh rock light (10m high). This lighthouse was built in the autumn of 1875 and was originally known as Black Rock. It was converted to electric batteries in 1983. Waves also break over the Black Rock beacon (red) just off Leabgarrow pier. If in doubt, follow the ferry route around the N end of the beacon and then down to the beach and the landing described in the Aranmore section.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Aranmore Island</strong> B685-156          Sheet 1 Mostly known more simply as ‘Aran’. The island is mountainous at 227m high and about 6.5<em>km</em> square, the largest island off Ireland not connected by bridge. Day trippers can enjoy a circular walk called Siúlóid Aran Mhóir, almost entirely on roads and good bog tracks and rivals the necklace walk on Great Blasket. The island has a stable and prosperous population of about 650, considerable by island standards. Landing and Camping The main landing is onto a sheltered sandy beach in front of the main village, midway up the E coast. The strand is bounded on the N side by two piers and on the S by a gentle point, where there is excellent camping near the new school, beside a football pitch. The more northerly pier is the busy ferry pier. In normal conditions, land at the extreme S end of the beach at B685-156, from which there is a very short carry. The best landing in N winds is at the N end, in the shelter of the smaller, S pier. This avoids the surf farther down the beach but carrying to camp is then a problem. Water in the village. The S end of the beach is the best semi-private camping convenient to everything. Remoter camping exists elsewhere as described. Accommodation and Services A many-times-a-day ferry services the island with a sheltered run from the mainland at Burtonport. The ferry runs punctually during peak (usually summer) times but less so in the off-peak. The car ferry can take up to 8 cars, is regular and well run. Information can be had from Annie Bonner at 074 9520532 who also runs a restaurant and B&amp;B on Aran at the pier. There is a hostel by the beach which also appears well run, 074 9520515. Glen Hotel is just above the beach for those seeking comfort at 074 9520505. Circumnavigation From the paddler’s point of view, the entire W side is challenging. Great cliffs reflect huge waves, especially at the steeper cliffs and mighty headlands. There would often be no real stopping point between the two waystops midway on the S and N coasts next described. That involves 14<em>km</em> of committed paddling on the outside stretch. With ‘pottering’, allow almost 20<em>km</em> around the whole of the island altogether. Factor in the foul ground off the SE corner and this adds up to an achievable yet demanding circumnavigation. Some say it yields some of the finest seakayaking in Donegal, where the competition is plentiful.  Certainly it contains a real wealth of riches – with a tremendous variety of caves, arches and stacks to explore.  It deserves two days if the weather is favourable.</p>\n",

It is now automated. The steps are due S of the lighthouse, near where the straight wall reaches the cliff edge and inside a number of small off-lying stacks.

No one until recently has possessed the appetite.  Access is of itself committing, whether by floating past Tourneady Point to the N, or, for the climbs immediately at the lighthouse only, by abseil. The showpiece of the whole group of stacks and faces and ridges is the very visible landward ridge of the sea stack found immediately below the lighthouse.  The climbing and situations are superb.  The technical climbing grade is quite manageable on all theclimbing routes in this immediate area. 1<em>km</em> to the E at B653190, routes climb the 120m monster stack sitting in the middle of the ampitheatre of huge cliffs.  Access is by Torneady Point.  The climbing is hard and committing, varying from sound quartzite to grass and mud.  The better route is the steep seaward W ridge, and the landward face has its own virtues. 300m N lies a ridge climb of elegant simplicity at Grid Reference B654193. This truly monstrous 150m+ ridge rises from sea level to the summit. The ridge can be very easily seen from anywhere on this coast, immediately identifying itself on a quick glance at OS sheet 1.  Access to sea level is via Torneady Point. Simply follow the very  exposed crest of the ridge from sea to summit! 400m further N, just on the lighthouse side of Torneady Point, a stack at B654-196 gives good quality easier climbs, the N face route being the better. <strong>North West Donegal – Tidal Overview</strong> For Aran Island to Bloody Foreland, Horn Head, Tory Sound and the Inishbofin Group, local HW and LW are 40 minutes after Galway HW. The main northeast tidal stream in the area generally starts, half an hour ahead of the main west coast tidal stream as follows:</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"317\"><strong>Aran Island to Bloody Foreland</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"180\"><strong>Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"57\"><strong>Speed</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">NE</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">3:50 before Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"81\">SW</td>\n\n<td width=\"180\">2:35 after Galway HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"57\">1kn</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>However, it is important to note that this general statement does not hold good close in to Tory or amongst the inshore islands of the Cruit, Gola and Inishbofin Groups, where the details are given individually. The streams here tend to turn an hour or more earlier. In Tory Sound, the maximum spring rate is 2kn. At Bloody Foreland itself, as might be expected, usable eddies form inshore downstream.

The main offshore tidal stream from Aran to Bloody Foreland starts and finishes half an hour earlier than the main west coast tidal stream further S.

        "description": "<p><strong>Owey Island</strong> B719-229          Sheet 1 Owey is uninhabited since about 1980, with a deserted village. Some refurbishment seems to be in progress, and in 1991 it was thought that some of the houses might be summer occupied by former islanders, or by persons wanting solitude more than comfort. In 2009 up to 8 houses had been restored in some ways. 2 log cabin type holiday houses had also been newly built. The island seems to be visited far more frequently than before. There is neither mains electricity nor water. A pleasant island, square shaped, tilted a bit anticlockwise, with granite sea cliffs all along its N half. Well worth a visit. A distinctive type of curragh was found in this region which was sculled over the bow and was used by islanders for access to and from the small pier on Cruit. Embarkation The nearest launching place for Owey is at the N end of Cruit, opposite Owey. Launch from a sheltered beach and slipway at B724-224, just below a golf clubhouse. Park in the clubhouse car park. Beware of flying golf balls when crossing to the slip as you’re on the 18th fairway and the golfers are unsighted at that point. From a car, the more convenient embarkation point is from a harbour B742-210, about 1<em>km</em> NW of Kincaslough, which is sheltered, where the parking is convenient, and is free of aerial bombardment. Landing and Camping The traditional landing place is at a slipway on the E point, in a small sheltered cove at the N end of the narrows opposite Cruit Island. The slipway in the cove is easily found coming from the N but can be missed coming from the S, as the cove opens ENE and is low lying. The markers are a large rock in the Sound, the cove itself and a prominent schoolhouse on the island all in line. There are lights on Cruit at 070º leading into the Sound from the S. In 2009 a new pier had been built on the S side but it is ugly and unattractive and poorly constructed.  Any boat activity observed was into the original landing. Water and Camping There is water in the stream through the village. Camping at slip. 10 Corncrake were heard calling in 2010. Rock Climbing There is excellent rock climbing on good granite, relatively undeveloped. It started in 1991, began in earnest in 1993 and there are now a few dozen routes. Some routes just 300m north of the landing place at the S end of ‘the Canyon’ do not need an abseil for access. With an abseil there are more in the Canyon itself at its N end, in the first cove N of the Canyon, and on slabs at the NE point. The NNW coast of the island has not yet begun to yield its unlimited climbing potential, though it will, well into the future, especially to access from the water. <em>Cladagharoan</em> (Seal Shore) B715-237, a small bay immediately S of the NE corner, is famous in sea stack circles.  It contains what must be the most spectacular small needle stack in the country called locally <em>Tor a’Mhadaidh Uisce</em> (Sea Dog Tor) but is shown on larger OS land maps as<em>Stackaniller</em> (presumably from <em>Stacán an Iolair</em>), wonderfully metamorphosed by climbers to <em>Stackamillion</em>.  First noticed by climbers in 1991, it was climbed in 2003 by a Polish party led by Andrzej Smialy, featured in a photographic competition in 2004, and was strongly reported to have collapsed shortly after that.  I am certain that only Ozymandias would have approved.  Rumours of its collapse proved incorrect.  It is still there. Circumnavigation Circumnavigation gives good caves, canyons, channels and stacks. Owey in Irish – ‘Uigh’, means ‘Caves’. There is a through cave with a right angle turn going through the NE tip. There is a passage on the NW side of the island which is entered from the land, leading to a large underground cavern. There are deep sea caves along the ENE side, including one with connecting chambers. These are easily accessible when the wind is from the S/SW. A through cave system also located in SW corner, where in a bay with 3 caves take the right hand one, to exit next bay E. Tides Local HW and LW are Galway +0100. Tidal streams in the sound with Owey turn with the tide by the shore, or half an hour later, flowing very strongly indeed and can cut up very rough in contrary winds.</p>\n",

See the fish-holding tanks in offshore rocks off the SE side. A nice sea cave on the N side deserves a look. The grass is a bit long for camping. No grazing. No water. Embarkation and Landing Land in a sandy cove in a cut on the SE side. There is a good embarkation point from a harbour about 1<em>km</em> NW of Kincaslough, where the parking is convenient, and which is sheltered. <strong>Gola Section</strong> This section stretches from Inishfree Lower in the S to Inishsirrer in the N. The generally most convenient embarkation point for all the islands of the Gola Group and certainly for Gola Island is from a pier at B793-266 just N of the entrance to Gweedore Bay. It is the more northerly of the two such piers locally. By road from Derrybeg, go past the football pitch, then the graveyard and then fork right. There is good camping beyond the graveyard along the access road but no water.  There is good parking by the pier, and a beautiful beach. Ferry An all-year-round ferry to Gola is run by Jimmy Sweeney 087 6607003. It leaves from Bunbeg Pier B802-235. The Tory ferry is based here, as the harbour is very sheltered. Nearest provisions are to be had in a shop at the main road, 2<em>km</em> or more from the pier. Full provisions are available in Bunbeg, just S of Derrybeg. Bunbeg harbour is accessible to kayaks at all stages of the tide. There is a hostel 1<em>km</em> up the road from Derrybeg in Magheragallon, 07495 32244. Ensure the tide is with you in the estuary, local HW being Galway +0100. For the N part of the group there is also an excellent pier right opposite Inishmeane at B799-284 known locally as Carrick Pier. Here there is an extensive sandy beach, good camping on machair grassland or in dunes behind the pier, but no water. By road, drive 3<em>km</em> N out of Derrybeg, then (1<em>km</em> N of a significant junction), follow signs left for ‘Beach’, and continue past an enclosed soccer pitch.</p>\n",

Land onto a beach on the N side. Otter.  Well worth the effort for the peace at HW. Spanish Armada In 1901 a group of Dublin archaeologists found a mass grave of Formorians, ancestors of the modern Gael, which had become disturbed by rabbits, exposing the remains of the long dead.  The bones were carbon dated to 3,000 years before present but the real mystery was the great assortment of bones of young men buried nearby with vastly different bone structure, and of a much later vintage altogether, late 16<sup>th</sup> century. They had accidentally stumbled upon the burial site of most of the soldiers and sailors of <em>La Juliana</em>, an 860 ton Spanish grain carrying merchantman pressed into service for the great invasion of England 1588.  Italian, it was impounded into the Levantine Squadron of the Spanish Armada and given large poopdecks for the comfort of the officers, besides 32 cannon and 1,600 cannonball as ballast.  Sailing was difficult under benign conditions, treacherous otherwise.  It was one of four such vessels that went down on 28<sup>th</sup> September 1588.  La Juliana foundered SW of Gola with great loss.  Two utility boats were launched.  Two soldier captains and a troop of soldiers made Maghernagallon Bay on Gola in one, and six of the original unknown complement of the other (with the ship’s treasure chest) made Inishcoole. 20 or so was all of the 70 Italian crew and 325 Catalan solidiers to survive.  Three other boats perished similarly, only one reliably named, the <em>Santiago</em>.  Rumours of buried treasure on Inishcoole, Gola and the mainland are not uncommon. This was but one of many such tragedies.  In retreat homewards that autumn, many ships of the great Armada sank, 39 off Ireland, 10 off Scotland (4 in the E, 6 in the W), and 2 up in Shetland. The tale received value added when Robert Louis Stevenson came to honeymoon in Bunbeg in late 1880.  An autumnal gale shifted a lot of sand about the place, revealing some valuable commodities.  Captivated by the tales he was told of <em>La Juliana</em> and her colourful crew, and other research on the Armada he undertook, he wrote a great work of fiction around them.  The captain had a peg-leg, an eye patch, a crutch, and a parrot sat on his shoulder.  Long John Silver is a composite of two sailors marooned from <em>El Gran Griffon</em> on Fair Isle.  Treasure Island is Gold Island (“Gola”), which prior to 1588 was call McGee Island.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Gola Island</strong> B773-271          Sheet 1 This is a truly beautiful island, a must to visit. The island is now uninhabited, though the houses show signs of being kept up, and an increasing number of summer homes have been built. Against the national trend, the population grew during the 19<sup>th</sup> century, rising from 70 in 1841 to 200 in 1930. Numbers dwindled after that and it was finally empty by the mid-70s. Unusually, there was never a church on the island. Mains water and electricity were supplied to the island in 2005,a nd there is a public tap 10m from the pier on the E side. In a remarkable feat of co-operation, the water and the electricity were placed in the same trench. A book ‘Gola, the Life and Last Days of an Island Community’ by Aalen and Brody was written in 1969 and a film ‘Terminus’ was made by RTE at the same time. Gola is famed also in song, ‘<em>Báidín Fheidhlimí, d’imigh go Gabhla</em>…’ was about a drowning tragedy involving a Gola boat on passage to Tory. It was written by Felim’s brother, the renowned seanchai of Rannefast in the nearby Rosses.  Two Gola men Patrick McGinley and Charles Duggan are commemorated at Mullach an Aird for having been in the crew of the <em>Asgard</em>, the gun running yacht that armed the Irish Volunteers in 1914.  They sailed into Howth in Dublin under Erskine Childers.  The episode made the Easter Rising 1916 possible. Landing and Camping Land at the modern concrete pier and sheltered beach on the E side, the main landing point for the island. The main village, called Portacrin, is on the S side and is exposed to south-westerlies. A number of sandy beaches exist at the SE corner of the island, which provide soft landings in any conditions. There are a number of other landing places available which are sheltered from different sea and weather conditions. A south-facing beach, near the E tip, has good camping on grass by its W end. A storm beach landing is possible at all stages of the tide in Magheranagall Bay at B764-269, the deep indented bay on the W. Camping is possible here but departure may be difficult if the sea gets up. Mains water at houses. 3 Corncrake were heard calling in 2010. Circumnavigation Circumnavigation offers spectacular views of cliffs, arches and caves. Tororragaun Sound on the N side, between Gola and Umfin, can be lumpy at times, being shallow, and a lot of clapotis can be expected on the W side. A tunnel penetrates through the tip of the N side of Magheranagall Bay at its seaward end, which is worth looking out for if there is not too much swell. The entrance is not obvious from either end. Rock climbing Gola has excellent climbing on good granite, more developed than Owey and very popular. Climbs have been put up on the N side of Magheranagall Bay and on the sea cliffs of Mweelmore, the hill S of Magheranagall Bay, facing S towards Owey. There are hundreds of climbs there as of 2010.  The 2002 Donegal climbing guide book edited by Alan Tees and published by the Mountaineering Council of Ireland www.mountaineering.ie in 2002 has all the Gola climbs.

Many easy / middle grade high quality rocks climbs await the visitor. <strong>North Donegal</strong> <strong>Rockall</strong> No Irish Grid Reference  No Irish OS Sheet          (British Grid Reference NF 68694-70525) Rockall is the most disputed, the most infamous, the most unique, the most isolated, the most desolate and the most far-flung island off the Irish coast.  It is located at <a href=\"http://stable.toolserver.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Rockall&amp;params=57_35_48_N_13_41_19_W_\">57°35′48″N, 13°41′19″W</a>, just 424<em>km</em> NW of Bloody Foreland in County Donegal. Rockall is an extinct volcano, disputed by Ireland, the UK, Iceland and Denmark (on behalf of the Faeroes). The islet is located approximately 430<em>km</em> SE of Iceland, 461.5<em>km</em> NW of Ardnamurchan point (though much closer is St. Kilda Island at 301.4<em>km</em>) Embarkation There is no immediately obvious embarkation point for this island, by kayak or otherwise. Landing Neither is there an easy landing spot.  A sustained settled spell is required. The depth of the waters generally surrounding the rock is over 1000m, but this rapidly shallows to 150m within 2<em>km</em> of the rock itself, which looms up out of the depths. There are some off-lying reefs, so caution is needed against rogue swells, and even boomers. There are very strong surges and scends around the base of the rock. Summiting The island itself is solid rock rising to a height of approximately 20m. While the surface is all rock, it has a soft, malodorous, slimy guano coating which is rather pungent, thus making the island very slippy, apart from the areas regularly stripped by the swell.  The S side of the islet is almost vertical. The other sides are steep and cracked. The rock is granitic in texture and has unusual pock marks, which makes climbing the initial section relative easy (if you survive the swell). It is strongly recommended that both landers have at least limited rock climbing experience. Low down on the W side there is a “thread belay” which is invaluable in fixing both the climbers and the boat to a secure belay point.  From there, it is easy but exposed scrambling along sloping ledges to the summit. The exposure to noise and waves below can be a bit unnerving.  Upon achieving the summit one is rewarded by a magnificent vista of nothing but open sea, thus giving an interesting sense of vulnerability. Current Position On the summit in 2007 all that remained was part of the base of a navigation beacon which had been removed by the swell at some stage. Within the base of this, some Fulmars clung to the inner margins for shelter, and were not in the least perturbed by human presence. Camping / Water / Hall’s Ledge There is a ledge near the summit with some modern “bolts”.  The ledge is named after the leader of the first landing party in 1810, Lieutenant Basil Hall. It would be possible to spend a night here, but probably not to be recommended. Obviously due to the barren nature of the rock there is no freshwater available. History The first known landing was on 8<sup>th</sup> July 1810 by a party from HMS <em>Endymion</em> led by Lieutentant Basil Hall, all of whom summitted. A member of a landing party from HMS <em>Porcupine</em>, the famous survey ship after whom the whole Porcupine Bank is named, a Mr Johns, gained a foothold, but did not summit, in 1862. Near the edge of Hall’s Ledge is a plaque claiming the rock as part of the British Empire. This was laid in 1955 by a landing party from HMS <em>Vidal</em> (coincidentally named after the man who first charted the island), that formally claimed the island for the UK. This claim was motivated by a fear that the Soviets would occupy Rockall to use it as a spying base.  The context was that Britain was about to launch the “Corporal”, its first ever guided nuclear missile, from Uist, so they were nervous. The Irish, the Danes and the Icelanders sniggered. However in 1972 the UK Government passed the Isle of Rockall Act, formalising the claim, declaring it part of Inverness-shire. They even put an 80<em>km</em> exclusion zone around the rock. In 1975 Willie Dick summitted, and measured its height with a climbing rope.  His navigator Michael d’Alton measured the circumference at sea level by paddling around it trailing a long length of red twine. They found their measurements and the Rock generally “very close indeed to the description in St Brendan’s <em>Navigatio</em>”. They were left with no doubt that the Irish monks were well aware of it. D’Alton also landed nearby Hasselwood Rock by partly swimming.  Hasslewood only shows in the troughs at LW, and he said it was like straddling a horse. He took one rock sample. Conceivably this was the only landing ever on Hasslewood? Still Ireland and the rest laughed, denying the claim on the grounds that no one could live on the rock. Ireland, Iceland, and Denmark argued (successfully in the end) that barren rocks which cannot sustain life are part of the environment, and their “ownership” depends on other factors like “continental shelfs”, that may create rights but barren rocks are not self proclaiming merely for being visible above the surface. So the British sent the SAS to reinforce their claim and left Tom McClean to live on the rock for 39 days in 1985 from 26<sup>th</sup> May to 4<sup>th</sup> July, explaining the present day bolts to hold down the module which housed his sleeping quarters. The manoeuvring continued.  Our own Sean “Dublin Bay” Loftus legally changed his name by Deed Poll to Sean Dublin Bay “<em>Rockall</em>” Loftus, to promote Ireland’s claim and denounce Albion’s perfidy. The Wolfe Tones released a song “Rock on Rockall” to highlight Ireland’s interest. A 1986 party including the renowned arctic explorers John Gore-Grimes and Pat Colleran landed and summitted, fuelling Irish populist ambitions.  Irish British diplomacy had suffered a set-back in 1982 over differenig attitudes to events in the South Atlantic, and feelings were still stirred at the time. In 1997 the environmentalist organisation Greenpeace occupied the islet for a short time, calling it Waveland, to protest against oil exploration under the authority of the British. They asserted their claim by renaming the rock “Waveland”. Greenpeace declared the island to be a “new Global State”, and offered citizenship to anyone willing to take their pledge of allegiance. The British Government’s response was simply to give them permission to be there, and otherwise ignore them. Kevin O’Callaghan (a.k.a. GEO), first President of the Irish Sea Kayaking Association, summitted in 2007. Departing The most difficult operation on Rockall is to vacate the place in one piece. It is easiest to launch the boat and get it beyond the wave-breaking zone, then swim out after it, very reminiscent of Fastnet. Shipwreck Despite its lonely position, a major shipwreck took place here on 28th June 1904.  The passenger steamer Norge <em>en route</em> Oslo to New York struck an off-lying reef and went down quite quickly.  There were insufficient lifeboats for all aboard.  Two of the lifeboats were lost while being put out, and the rest were quickly filled.  Everyone else had to swim for Rockall itself or perish.  The full lifeboats deliberately left the scene rather than be swamped by the despairing swimmers. A trawler happened upon the scene within hours, but it was too little too late.  600+ drowned. International Law The relevant law is the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982.  Everyone except USA and Uzbekhistan has signed up.  This agreement provides for “extended continental shelf” claims in certain circumstances beyond the “normal” limit of the “exclusive economic zones” projecting seaward from sovereign states for 200<em>nm</em> from their coastline, the usual limit that everyone agrees in principle that everyone else may enjoy. These rules work well in most circumstances. There are less than 20 disputes worldwide to go to the scientific committee of the UNCLOS, the final arbiter in these things.  Most disputes involve competing neighbours disagreeing benchmarks or angles. Russia did plant a flag on the seabed of the North Pole, but no one takes that seriously. On the other hand, when for instance the UK ratified the Convention, it gave up its (previously claimed) right to a 200nm zone around Rockall, and effectively rowed in with the opposition views in the matter. Ireland has a huge undisputed wedge of the NE Atlantic.  In acreage terms we box well above our weight.  The undisputed part of our 200nm EEZ extends over large parts of the Hatton Basin in addition to the Rockall Trough/Bank The Irish undisputed area does not however include the position where the rock of Rockall lies.  Ireland is in dispute with Iceland, Denmark and the UK for seabed type rights of the 200<em>nm</em>+ type with regard to a huge area of seabed that (inconsequentially) does include Rockall, so the issue is “live”.  The Danes have recently clarified their claim, so the adjudication process should begin soon enough. Rockall isn’t urgent.  The main current national economic benefit of the Rockall area is in its fishery, and the management of EU fisheries were in any event ceded to the EU many years ago.   It is overstating it that sovereignty has also thus been ceded, but realistically, if Iceland were to join the EU, the whole position would be moot entirely. <strong>Tory Group</strong> <strong>Inishbeg, Inishdooey</strong> and <strong>Inishbofin</strong> together form a worthwhile group for a day trip or for an overnight camp, or just for shelter on passage out to Tory.

        "description": "<p><strong>Tory Island</strong> B856-464          Sheet 1 12<em>km</em> NNE of Bloody Foreland, Tory is named for the dramatic appearance of the high tors at its E end as seen from the mainland; this is the most remote inhabited Irish island and holds a special place in history. SPA Tory is the only inhabited island the entire of which is so designated.  Storm Petrel, Tern, Chough, Corncrake, of which 10 males were calling in 2010. Facilities The main pier on the island is at Camusmore Bay serving West Town at B855-465. In the village there is water available, two shops, a new hotel, hostel, cafe, pub and post-office. Camping Camping is possible at West Town, but a bit public. A more remote landing can be had onto a storm beach at Port an Dúin on the E end of the island at B877-454. This is the dramatic square-shaped indent in the skyline, just E of the last house on the island. Camping may be dramatically had on the flat ground just above the cliffs. The disadvantage of camping here is that all visitors walking to the Anvil and Tormore pass directly by. For larger groups, or those requiring privacy or greater security, perhaps in high season, a well sheltered landing may also be had hereabouts at a small storm beach (HW) / sand beach (LW) just 500m W of Port an Dúin. There is good camping at the shore directly SW of the last dwelling on this side of the island at B874-453. In either case, there is good water at a spring beside this house, where asking would be respectful. Tides Tory is a challenging trip, at almost 13<em>km</em> out from Magheraroarty Pier at B889-333. However, the Inishbofin Group shelters half of this, and the trip out can be broken. Local HW is Galway +0040. In the middle of Tory Sound, the ENE flood runs from HW Galway 0350 to +0235. Close in to Tory and to the islands of the Inishbofin Group, (as well as in and around and through the Inishbofin Group), the tidal streams turn one hour earlier. The E making flood runs from HW Galway 0450 to +0135. Slack occurs about one hour after local HW/LW. As the exposed part of the passage between Tory and Inishbeg takes an hour or so, and as another hour is needed for the passage between Inishbeg and Magheraroarty, it is impossible to organise slack water all the way across. Local advice is to emphasise the later ‘middle of Tory Sound’ tide for planning purposes, accepting some wind over tide as necessary in the first or last part of the trip, to taste. Circumnavigation The N and E sides of the island are sheer for their entire length and offer no rest other than as mentioned below. A landing may be had at three places on the north side.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediately behind Port an Dúin at B876-456 onto a sheltered storm beach.</li>\n<li>A very sheltered landing onto a sandy beach 300m N of West Town at B855-468, at the head of a deep cut, but regrettably, under grassy cliffs.</li>\n<li>Onto a slipway near the W end of the N side at B849-471, just south of a prominent house.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The scenery on the N/NE sides is magnificent. The whole E end from Port an Dúin outwards is a prehistoric promontory fort known as Dún Balair, once the stronghold of Balor of the Evil Eye, the baddest of Fomorian bad guys. He ended up being killed by his own grandson, Lewey, who penetrated his one good eye with a huge wooden stake. Lewey hailed from Dunlewy at the foot of Errigal mountain on the mainland to the south. Lewey was mean and was nicknamed ‘Lewey Lamh Fhada’ meaning ‘long arms’, a reference to his habit, when he came to visit, of having one arm as long as the other i.e., empty handed. The remains of Balor’s four outer defensive ramparts may still be seen. His citadel is the mighty Tormore, an unapproachable pinnacle at the end of an alpine rocky ridge, called The Anvil, sticking N out to sea. Note the cairn on its summit put there by local kids for a dare. The Anvil may be bypassed on circumnavigation by going though a majestic arch at B878-460. The cliffs change from quartzite in the E to granite in the W. The cliffs at the E end of the N side are unsurpassed anywhere for unyielding verticality. Arches and offshore reefs abound for the more daring paddlers. Clapotis may be always expected on the W side, by the lighthouse and S of it. A shallow reef sticks far out to sea at the SW corner, which must be given a very wide berth. The S side is less dramatic, being flat, but the ground inshore at the W end is shallow for some way out and boomers may catch the unwary. Best to keep well off. Climbing The development of climbing on Tory, all on its N face, is in its infancy.  Some routes were made in 2004 by the ubiquitous Alan Tees NNW of West Town.  P. Stevens and others climbed 4 prominient 50m sea stacks that sit either side of the huge natural tower at B869-462 N of East Town. This tower is attached the main island of Tory by a knife edge ridge and can be clearly seen from mainland Donegal as the high pillar bisecting the island. To the NW of the tower sits a trio of conical spires and to the SE sits an excellent twin summited “V” stack. Art Derek Hill first came to Tory in 1957 or so, and rented as his studio the former Lloyds signalling station above the slip at B849-471.  Locals came and watched.  Some learned as they watched and in particular James Dixon felt he could do better and said so.  Hill encouraged him and in time there was a flourishing school of local artists with a distinctive naturalistic style, capturing what they knew best – cliffs, boats, wild sea and sky, the island villages and people.  The Tory art tradition still flourishes. Local History Tory’s most famous shipwreck is that of HMS Wasp in 1884 when the ship struck in daylight just near the lighthouse. 51 men died and only six survived. The incident is hard to explain, as the visibility was good so the lighthouse must have been visible for hours and the ship struck just after dawn. It has been attributed to a curse having been put on the ship with the aid of local cursing stones. There were also personality problems in the ranks of the officers and men of the ship, whose attitude to their work of carrying out forcible evictions up and down the west coast varied greatly. At the time of the wreck, Wasp was carrying policemen to evict the inhabitants of Inishtrahull. Much has been written about the myth, legend and history in which the island is steeped, especially ‘Stories from Tory Island’ by Dorothy Harrison Therman, Wallace Clark’s ‘Sailing Round Ireland’, and more recently “The Waves of Tory” by Jim Hunter. There are remains of a Columban church and of a round tower in West Town. Beside the tower is a very unusual tall cross, ‘T’ shaped, called a ‘Tau’, almost unique in Ireland. The cross is 3,000 years old and was adopted into Christianity. Colmcille himself founded the monastery here in the 560s. There are three types of curragh associated with Tory, the smallest of which was the smallest in Ireland, at eight feet, handled by one oarsman, kneeling at the bow. Nowadays there is only one type, the two-man curragh found all over North Donegal. Of note locally also is the more modern type of double-ended (i.e. transomless) clinker boats somewhat peculiar to Tory, usually white, said to be livelier handlers than transomed boats and with a mast that is purely for the radio. They are the subject of a book by Dónal MacPolin, entitled ‘The Drontheim, Forgotten Sailing Boat of the North Irish Coast’. There are no trees or rats on Tory.  The wind prevents the former and the soil the latter.  A handful of Tory clay brought home and stored in your house will keep it forever rat free, but only if the clay is properly acquired.  It must be asked for in the traditional manner “in the name of God and Colmcille” from the eldest member of the Duggan family living on Tory. Rare birds turn up frequently on Tory and those breeding include Corncrake, Storm Petrel and Little Tern. Legal affairs are carried out most informally on the island, with land being transferred without anything at all being put down in writing by the parties to the deal. Instead, land ownership and inheritance is settled by the island king.  They let the resident priest know his decision and he keeps a track of who owns what. Tory was once renowned for its Poitín making and it was the turf burned in its illicit stills that accounts for the barren look Tory now presents. Its huge tracts of bog, once rich, are now barren desert, home mostly to rabbits. There is now a modern hotel in West Town and some modern housing beginning to appear, but most streets and roadways on the islands present a somewhat 19th century appearance. A salvaged World War 2 torpedo marks the high point of the road between the two villages, East Town and West Town. The island has its own king, Patsy Dan Rogers.  The king is voted in for life.  Nowadays his duties have a lot to do with promoting and managing tourism. The permanent population is approximately 120, swelling to 190 in summer.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Horn Head</strong> C012-423          Sheet 2 The mainland coastline from Bloody Foreland to Horn Head (Sheets 1/2) is mostly sandy beaches. Horn Head is a local ‘big’ paddle, well worth the shuttle for its magnificent coastal features on a grand scale. Other than as mentioned below, the paddle is a nonstop 15<em>km</em>. Pollaguill Bay at B990-388 is the obvious rest-stop enroute, midway between Horn Head and the Back Beach, about 4.5<em>km</em> from each. Also, less obvious, though dependable in all but bad W/NW winds, is a well sheltered storm beach in a deep west-facing cut, 1<em>km</em> SW of Horn Head itself at C006-413. From here, there is at least the theoretical possibility of human escape (in dire emergency) up the tall cliffs of Coastguard Hill, which lean back slightly in the gully. This storm beach probably represents a more convenient way stop for those on more serious passages. <strong>Shuttle</strong> Put in or out on the W side at a beach unnamed on the map but known locally as the ‘Back Beach’ at B948-350 (Sheet 1). Turn N off the main coast road 1.5<em>km</em> E of Falcarragh, following signs for ‘Trá’, eventually to a good car park where the River Ray flows into the sea. This beach involves a carry and may surf. Better perhaps to start on this side, to be disappointed before, rather than after, a long paddle. If it is surfing badly, try Magheraroarty Pier further W at B889-333. A last resort option might be Ballyness on the E side of Ballyness Bay at B923-336, NW of Falcarragh, but watch the bar on the way out. On the E side, there is a good, sheltered, dependable ‘inallconditions’ pier C047-372 near Portnablagh, 3<em>km</em> E of Dunfanaghy, just off the main road. Tides A sustained lump may be expected, as this is a significant headland, so avoid any wind over tide. The Round of Horn Head is thus perhaps best done W to E on the flood in calm or light westerlies. Tides are as Tory Sound, ENE from HW Galway 0350 to +0235. This is half an hour ahead of the main west coast tidal stream, or a couple of hours behind the rise and fall by the shore. SPA Peregrine, Chough.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Inch (<em>Inis</em>) Island</strong> C310-265          Sheet 2/6 Situated at the head of Lough Swilly, Inch is now attached to the mainland due to extensive drainage and reclamation works on the SE side. Inch can be accessed by two-lane roads, and lacks all island feeling. There are even small housing estates.  The population is about 350 but there is no village, pub or shop. The whole SE of the island is an extensive farm that featured infamously some years ago in a major legal battle during the 1980s depression. Its owners were evicted by a bank for failure to meet mortgage repayments.  The channels along the S and NE sides dry at lower tide levels to reveal extensive ‘<em>glár’</em>, a local term for unpleasant grey knee-deep silt. Only enter these channels on a rising tide! The SE ‘channel’ contained within a barrage at each end is actually a fresh water lake, constantly pumped out to keep the salt water at bay. Circumnavigation is therefore impossible. Only the W side has any real interest to small boats. The highest point on the island is Inch Top in the NW at 222m high, a pleasant walk. At the extreme S tip of the island lies Inch Castle, now in ruins. Built about 1430 by Neachtain O’Donnell for his father-in-law, Cahir O’Doherty, who jailed a rival chieftain Dónal O’Donnell in it. O’Donnell managed to escape and take over the castle, but in 1454 his enemy Rúairí O’Donnell laid siege to the castle and tried to burn him alive in it. The remains of Inch Fort, a later fortification, are at the extreme N tip. Embarkation By road, a left turn off the R238 from Letterkenny towards Buncrana, after the village of Burnfoot, C358-248. From the E side of Swilly at a small pier near Fahan C334-267 near the sailing club. From the W side of Swilly at Rathmullan pier C299-277 or the beach beside it. Landing and Camping Land at the island pier, C310-265 at the NW of the island. Some occupied houses make the limited camping above the small beach at the pier a bit public. Inch Fort is nearby. Whooper In winter there are Whooper Swans on the lake area a-plenty, this being the Irish landfall in autumn for the entire wintering Irish population.  Counts of 2,000 occur.  Greenland White-fronted Geese also occur in numbers. Sandwich Tern breed in summer. Otter may be found on the island.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Round of Malin Head</strong> C381-590          Sheet 3 Malin Head is popularly but incorrectly known as the most northerly point of Ireland. In fact nearby (2<em>km</em> ENE) Dunaldragh Head at C398-598 is the most northerly point. Malin Head faces west and is small, low-lying and thoroughly undistinguished, except for the seas off it. Dunaldragh Head faces north and is a high rocky headland, complete with a Lloyds Signalling Station since 1805, an Eire sign from 1939, and lookout sheds from the same period. There is a nice non-waymarked trail around the immediate area. Tides The tidal streams in the area are complex and require careful study, after which passage close inshore is perfectly feasible. The diagrammatic hour-by-hour sketches in the Sailing Directions are highly recommended. Paddlers have studied these for days at a time and found them remarkably accurate. Remember:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local HW is approximately 1 hour after Galway HW.</li>\n<li>Belfast HW is approximately Galway LW.</li>\n<li>Belfast HW is 15 minutes before Dover HW.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Beware that HW at Malin village can be as much as 3 hours behind HW in Lough Swilly outside.</em> At about an hour before local HW, which is HW Dover -0600, the flood stream starts hammering eastwards and is split by its collision with Malin Head. This gives associated turbulence, initially off Dunaldragh Head, followed (after about an hour or so) by Malin Head itself, until about HW Dover -0400. Then there is slack for about an hour until HW Dover -0300. Then until about HW Dover the inshore flow around the Head favours a passage S to N, but beware wind over tide. From about HW Dover +0100 until about +0400 the stream is hammering west, so that eddies are set up inshore and these turbulently collide with the main flow, mostly at Dunaldragh Head and to the E of it, making things difficult indeed. Therefore the only reliable window of opportunity is at about Dover -0400 or -0300, an hour or two after local HW. If travelling anticlockwise, aim to pass the danger zone closer to HW Dover -0400 than -0300, and if going clockwise, there is slack at HW Dover -0400, followed by several hours of mostly favourable flow until HW Dover. The really troublesome times are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Dover HW -0600 to -0500, which is local HW –0100 to local HW and</li>\n<li>Dover HW +0100 to +0400, which is local LW to local LW +3000</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In calm conditions, paddlers will succeed anytime, but do respect that there is significant turbulence hereabouts at other times. Short Option A worthwhile half-day trip around the head is between Malin Pier at C423-586 in Slievebane Bay and the small pier in a sheltered bay locally named as Port Ronan (or West Town on the OS 1:50,000 at C406-573). A 2<em>km</em> walk saves a shuttle. One and a half hours in all, quite leisurely. There are regular escape points along the route, so the only committed section is the 2<em>km</em> section between Malin Head and Dunaldragh Head, where you also have the best cliffs, scenery, caves and waves. There is a 400m long passage, only a boat width in places, at Dunaldragh, which is thought might be passable at higher water. The nearest escape point on the N side is at C404-595 where a stream falls onto the beach and on the S at C387-589 in Breasty Bay, or more leisurely in Ineuran Bay at C390-584. There is a newly upgraded pier facility at Port Ronan, which is hard enough to spot, but there are now half a dozen or so holiday homes clustered above. It is almost at the E end of the high ground. There is a useful hostel in a prime position just at Port Ronan, for a kayaking meet or for the weary passer-by. Longer Option A longer trip at 35<em>km</em> with a short shuttle is from the bridge in Malin village at C470-498 (or from Port Ronan, a longer shuttle, paddling distance 23<em>km</em>) to Portaleen Pier at C525-528 or a small pier near Culdaff at C538-507. Departing Malin village has the disadvantage of a long trip through Trawbreaga Bay, which needs an appropriate tide. Beware that HW at Malin village can be as much as 3 hours behind HW in Lough Swilly outside. Any of these longer options include the committing 11<em>km</em> section of escape-proof cliffs from the Garvan Isles to Glengad Head, which are quite stunning and highly recommended. The stretch from Malin Pier to Culdaff is unremitting with high and brooding cliffs. An early morning paddle perhaps! The stacks add interest along the route but caves and arches are very few and far between. There are good numbers of breeding Fulmars along the high cliffs and the stacks hold Kittiwakes and Auks. A flood tide on this section is noticeable between the stacks at Reaghillan at C459-580 and Glengad Head at C526-547. Interesting tidal races set up quite unexpectedly at times. There are beaches of shingle and small pebbles under these cliffs but these may be exposed to a northerly swell. There is a small, well sheltered, east-facing shingle beach at C526-541 just S of Glengad Head near Burren, but at that stage it would probably make more sense to go on to the pier at Portaleen. Culdaff itself is an attractive place. There is a fine landing at Portaleen pier. You could also try a small picnic site up the Culdaff River at C537-499. There is a track from the picnic site to the river but at low tide getting up the narrow channel may sometimes be a problem. Alternatively, there is a gap in the sand dunes on the beach C540-500 with access to a car park behind. The coast from Glengad Head to Culdaff gets progressively lower in height and for the paddler the pier and river channel stay hidden from view until you are very close. On the S side, the extra journey has almost continuous escape potential. SPA Trawbreaga Bay is an SPA. Whooper Swan, Barnacle Goose, Golden Plover, Bar-tailed Godwit.  </p>\n",

Local fishermen say that to land sheep to graze Middle Isle, they used to manoeuvre a boat right up to the mouth of the slot and throw the sheep overboard. The sheep did the rest.

        "description": "<p><strong>Inishtrahull</strong> C482-652          Sheet 3 About 9<em>km</em> NE of Malin Pier, Inishtrahull is the most northerly ‘big’ island of Ireland. The passage by kayak takes about one and a half hours. Inishtrahull is a mighty island, about 1.5 <em>km</em> in length E/W and somewhat hourglass shaped. Hills form the E and W ends, joined by a low flat piece of ground where the abandoned village and farmland lie. It is thought monks were here in the early Christian era, but there is no sign now. Uninhabited since 1928, except for visiting lighthouse personnel, there are ruined cottages and lazy beds, and some rabbits. Beside the old schoolhouse there was until recently a huge flat rock with a Maltese cross inscribed, probably a Mass Rock, and which was stolen in 2009. There is at least one grave evident. Geology Ireland’s oldest rocks are to be found on Inishtrahull and the off-lying Tor Rocks. The rocks hereabouts were formed 1780 <em>ma</em> (billion years ago, during the Palaeoproterozoic Age), which is old, apparently. Consider that modern man has walked the earth for only 200,000 years and the last Ice Age occurred only 13,000 years ago. On Inishtrahull and the Tor Rocks, the rocks are known together as the Rhinn Complex and are made up of types of gneiss (pronounced ” nice”), a coarse crystalline metamorphic rock type, whose most identifiable characteristic is the tortured banded textures that bear witness to the enormous forces of burial or shearing to which the rocks have been subjected. Locally the gneiss is termed Augen (german for eye) where lozenge shaped crystals of pale-pink feldspar dominate the rocks fabric. Apparently it attracts a lovely blue-grey luminous lichen.  Syenitic orthogneiss basically means the rock was originally an igneous (magmatic) rock but has been severely buggered up by the subsequent continental barn-dancing The exact same rock types as the Rhinn Complex of Inishtrahull also crop out in the Hebrides, Greenland and Scandinavia. Paradoxically the rocks show no similarity to the deep basement rocks of the nearby Irish mainland. This observation was first noted in 1900 and published in 1930 by W. J. McCalliom, a graduate of Glasgow University. McCalliom grew to doubt his work probably because he could not explain the geographical separation between the apparently related rocks. It wasn’t until the 1960’s that the explanation for the dislocation became available, with the concept of “seafloor spreading”, that provided the mechanism that underpinned the theory of continental drift. Yet the question remained unresolved until 1989 when two geologists researching the gneiss’s of Islay and Colonsay in the Scottish Hebrides stumbled on the McCalliom report and created a paleogeographic reconstruction that proposed a link between Greenland, Islay, Colonsay and Inishtrahull in Palaeoproterozoic times. So now it is accepted that Inishtrahull, Colonsay and Islay broke free of the southern tip of Greenland, all those zillions of years ago.  The other two anchored off Scotland, but Inishtrahull drifted that bit further south to the Donegal coastline. Only two Irish kayakers are known to have visited any two of these locations, but both are working on completing the <em>meitheal</em>. Lighthouse A massive automated lighthouse stands at the west end, 23m high, reinforced concrete, novel in design. It flashes white 3 times every 20 seconds, built in 1958. There is a white accommodation block attached. A disused stub of a lighthouse stands at the east end, built in 1810/1813. It has a very visible base surrounded by large cogs, bits of machinery and derelict living quarters which could provide shelter if stranded. Because of its pivotal position, Inishtrahull Sound is a major route of passage for all sorts of living creatures and Basking Shark and Sunfish have been seen. Perhaps because of the strong tides, no debris is found on Inishtrahull, most unusual for such an island. Fauna In 1994, a herd of 5 Sika deer was brought onto the island, and 4 now remain as of May 2010, all does. They are very shy, and very efficient at keeping out of the way. It is more than possible for a small party never to find them on a visit. In summer 2001, a huge party of 200 or so visited the island for a commemoration. The deer could not evade so many forever, took flight, jumped into the sea, and swam for it. Fortunately, they were spotted leaving by some scuba divers walking about the island. A rescue mission was mounted. By the time they were found, they were two thirds the way to Malin Head. In the rescue efforts, unfortunately one drowned, the only stag. The remaining four were saved, and were returned at very high speed to the Hull. A good news story emanating from Ireland’s scuba people! In 2009 it became apparent to Ireland’s conservators of whales and dolphins that this whole Malin area was a hot-spot for Basking Shark (which actually are fish), and many of the 100+ tagged to try and find out where they go in winter were encountered near the island.  Then in 2010 there was an explosion of population and in a calm weather week in May, 104 were tagged in a frenzy of activity. This shy and elusive species may yet yield up, to technology, a ton of knowledge of its darkest secrets. Simon Berrow became a household name overnight. SPA Barnacle Goose, Peregrine, Arctic Tern, and a significant breeding Eider population. General Area Malin Head, pier, and the very pretty village are all on the well signposted coast road tour around the headland, the Inishowen 100. Malin Head Radio Station (VHF channel 23) has a very positive attitude to interaction with canoeists and a visit is very educational. Embarkation Embarkation is from Malin Pier C423-585 in the small harbour in Slievebane Bay, 4<em>km</em> E of Malin Head. The pier faces the Garvan Isles C436-602 at 2<em>km</em> out to the NE across Garvan Sound and Inishtrahull is 7<em>km</em> further out beyond them across Inishtrahull Sound in the same direction, 9<em>km</em> in all. Park so as not to obstruct fishermen. This recently improved pier supports the fishermen’s co-op for the whole area and is quite busy. Inishtrahull Sound The tides in Inishtrahull Sound itself, reaching about 4<em>kn</em> in Springs, are notorious with wind over tide and are said to get steeper more quickly than in Tory Sound, but are otherwise quite manageable. It tends to cut up rougher just W of the Garvan Isles than to their E. It is strongly advised to keep east of the Garvan Isles, bound inwards or out, in any wind. Landing The most convenient landing on the island is in the waist at the W end of the S side of the island just under the W lighthouse, where a narrow SW-facing cut leads to a jetty and steps, called Portachurry. The landing is said to be a problem as it can be exposed to swell. A much more sheltered landing is also possible in the waist of the island midway along the N side at Portmore. There is a jetty and an impressive 15m raised shingle beach. There is less of a carry at Portachurry. The well at Portmore seems well maintained. Tides</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Local HW is approximately HW Galway +0100.</li>\n<li>Belfast HW is approximately Galway LW.</li>\n<li>Belfast HW is Dover HW -0015.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Tides run strongly, are very complicated, and deserve respect. With wind over tide, the sea sets up steep waves more quickly in Inishtrahull Sound than even in Tory Sound or Rathlin Sound.</em> Tides The tides in Inishtrahull Sound reach about 4kn in springs and are notorious with wind over. They are said to get steeper more quickly than in Tory Sound but are otherwise quite manageable. It tends to cut up rougher to the west of the Garvan Isles than to the east. It is strongly advised to keep east of the Garvan Isles, bound inwards or out, in any wind. At Inishtrahull itself, there is shallow foul ground at the southwest, tidal races flood and ebb at the northwest and the island even boasts a whirlpool off the northeastern corner, a circular eddy that gets ferocious in springs, from an hour after Belfast HW until about 4:30 after. Fortunately, this whirlpool seems always avoidable, as Gull Island at the northeast is navigable inside by very small craft. The stream through Inishtrahull Sound on its southern side runs at full strength to within 3m of the shore off Portachurry and a 300m wide race guards the entrance to Portachurry during all the ebb. The main ESE flood stream passes outside the Garvan Isles, in Inishtrahull Sound itself, for 8 hours as follows:</p>\n<table>\n\n<tbody>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td colspan=\"3\" width=\"424\"><strong>Inishtrahull Sound</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\"><strong>Direction</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"173\"><strong>Start Time</strong></td>\n\n<td width=\"173\"><strong>End Time</strong></td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">ESE</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">3:00 after Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">1:30 before Belfast HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n\n<td width=\"78\">WNW</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">Belfast HW</td>\n\n<td width=\"173\">3:00 after Belfast HW</td>\n\n</tr>\n\n</tbody>\n\n</table>\n\n<p>There is virtually no slack at the start of the flood. There is an hour and a quarter of slack at the start of the ebb, although much less in springs, half an hour. At the Garvan Isles and in Garvan Sound to landward, the position is somewhat more complicated. The mainstream of the flood tide passes further out, through Inishtrahull Sound. Therefore, in Garvan Sound and through the Garvan Isles, the tide never runs with much strength ESE at any time, because of the eddying effect of being bypassed. In for the last couple of hours or so of the flood, the stream eddies back around and runs weakly WNW, from about 3:15 before Belfast HW to approximately Belfast HW. So the inshore ebb stream runs continuously WNW from 3:15 before Belfast HW until 2:45 after. It is stressed though that while it runs relatively weakly while an eddy (say 3:15 before Belfast HW to 0:15 before Belfast HW), it runs very strongly indeed on the main ebb for the rest of the time. The Garvan Isles must (please believe their reputation in this particular regard) be avoided during that period as the streams set strongly through its shallower channels and outlying rocks. To look is enough and do not go there. Best keep well east of them altogether on passage in or out and choose the timing carefully. It might seem soundest to leave the mainland at 1:45 before Belfast HW or so and ferry eastwards for a while against the weakly eddying flood inside the Garvans, until slack water outside the Garvans permits an untroubled trip across Inishtrahull Sound. Returning after multiples of twelve (not six) hours later, depart the island at 0:45 before Belfast HW or so, as soon as it looks right. Then bear up eastwards a little while, traversing the Inishtrahull Sound to be carried westwards home across the Garvan Sound, once close to land. There is also the ‘non-slack’ at about 2:45 before Belfast HW, when the direction of flow changes, they say instantaneously. In calm conditions, bite it. It really must be stressed that in calm conditions, both sounds are quite manageable and timing becomes more a matter of navigation and convenience than safety or necessity. For advance planning of trips, be aware that in neaps, Belfast HW falls during hours of darkness, which can mean usable slack waters force a choice between a return 12 hours later in the dark or 24 hours later, increasing the commitment levels somewhat. Realistically though, it is better to go spontaneously, when conditions invite.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><strong>Tor More</strong> C474-668          Sheet 3 Tor More is the biggest of a group of isolated rocky islets, skerries and sea stacks called the Tor Rocks, 1.5<em>km</em> NW of Inishtrahull, all consisting of the same rock type. Tides run very strongly in the sound between the Tor Rocks and Inishtrahull and indeed through the gaps and channels amongst the smaller rocks and skerries -hereabouts. Tor More, as the name suggests, is the highest in elevation of the group, rising to 35m. Tor More is high and craggy, especially so on its S flanks. Narrow channels divide it from three smaller outlying stacks. The angle of slope on its northern side is less, and landing is possible onto rock shelves in calm conditions. The summit can be reached easily enough from the northern side, the reward being a fine view of Inishtrahull from almost the most northerly points of Ireland. Evidence of breeding Shags and c.30 Grey Seal present in August 2003. Oystercatcher, Purple Sandpiper, Turnstone and Eider.</p>\n",
